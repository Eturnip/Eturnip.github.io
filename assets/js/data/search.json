    "content": "\t\t\t\tWriting recently has been &hellip; slow.I think doing the &lsquo;write a story every week for six weeks&rsquo; thing is great for getting a bunch of practice coming up with concepts. It&rsquo;s even great for completing projects, since you pretty much have to complete them to submit them. It does burn you out on writing for a bit though.I got back rejections for the last of the stories I had out, so for the first time in a while, I don&rsquo;t have anything in a queue at a magazine. I will send them back out, well at least one of them will be going back out, but still, it&rsquo;s a bit of a bummer to not have any out right now.I know that at least one of my six week stories can probably sell, but I also didn&rsquo;t want to turn around and send any out before I had a chance to really punch them up. I think I have forgotten them enough at this point to be able to edit and revise with a clear head.And then I have my two - no - three almost finished stories that I need to wrap up and send out. Along with all the flash stories I wrote last year. So there is no shortage of things to write or submit.I guess it&rsquo;s time to go peruse the markets again.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

More recently these posts have also been about fiction writing and everything that goes along with it.Well that ends today.Unbeknownst to you, and even me, I have spent the last decade writing a collection of the filthiest limericks ever conceived. Each one more grotesquely bawdy than the last. All of this work was conducted while in a deep, near comatose, sleep, and hidden below the foundation of my home.I believe that, in some self preserving subconscious place, I knew that these verses were not meant for waking eyes. But I have unearthed them, and I have read them, and I must unburden myself of them.Every week from here on out, I will release a single line from one of these foul poems. The first line of the first limerick is at the bottom of this page. With that, this place will forever become a marathon of horror, and for that I am sorry.There once was a man from Regina -&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThe 90&rsquo;s era arcade game that I have been working on for some time is finally starting to gel.The shaders that were very difficult to get right are nearly perfect.The pixel alignment script that took a while is now rock solid.The scale and angle of objects that didn&rsquo;t want to comfortably fit under an orthographic camera now seem to work properly.One of the last things I needed to nail down was how to consistently create textures that look and feel like sprite and tile pixel art. In common fashion, I&rsquo;m not creating them in the traditional way.People have been creating pixel art since the late 70s. Images that can be moved around a screen on discrete pixel unit at a time. That usually meant that they would draw the image out on graph paper, highlight specific colors if that was a capability of the hardware they were using, and then enter that &lsquo;map&rsquo; into their game as code. Or, if they were an artist and not a programmer, they would hand that sheet over to someone else to punch into the computer.That went on for quite a long time, well into the late 80&rsquo;s. Eventually computer aided art tools were developed that allowed artists to handle the art side independently. They would create the graphics and hand the finished file over to whoever was tasked with squeezing it into the game.A much cleaner workflow, but creating pixel art typically meant creating art a pixel at a time. Like a slightly less cumbersome light-bright.Gradually we got to the point where pressure sensitive tablets and screens using extremely sensitive electronic pens can pair with ridiculously sophisticated art software allow an artist to draw and paint as though they were using traditional media. It&rsquo;s actually sort of amazing.I&rsquo;m mostly using vector tools.Vectors drawing is like using mathematically defined shapes and regions to create art as opposed to scratching a mark onto a surface. The mark is easy to make, but it&rsquo;s mostly static. It stays how and where you put it. That can be very useful. Sometimes you just want to make a mark in a specific place in a specific color. But sometimes, you want to make a box, and then have that box remain scalable, rotateable, and variable forever. When I create using vector tools, I am defining the parameters of the image, parameters that I can change at almost any time.Creating pixel art with vectors lets you get away with a lot of strange things. Tiling and palette swaps are trivial. Creating variations on a single tile is not only easy, but kind of leans into how these vector packages work. It&rsquo;s playing to their strengths.I&rsquo;m sure that I&rsquo;m not the first person to do this. There are probably countless artists currently using this workflow for pixel art, but I haven&rsquo;t really seen it out there in the wild.Anyway, here, enjoy some parametrically created pixel art.   \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t                 \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t                 \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t \t \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - PaRappa the RapperHit buttons in time with the music. That&rsquo;s the pitch. That&rsquo;s PaRappa. It shouldn&rsquo;t work. It shouldn&rsquo;t be fun.For a time, rhythm games were the biggest thing in the world. Dance Dance Revolution, Beatmania, Guitar Hero, Rock Band, and on and on. They still exist, of course. No real arcade would be complete without some sort of dance based rhythm game at this point. They aren&rsquo;t as prominent as they once were, but it&rsquo;s almost difficult to imagine the world before rhythm games. Back when the most rhythm adjacent game you could find was Simon.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not sure if the core gameplay of PaRappa the Rapper would have worked if it had been as lean as many DDR games. Had the presentation of the game been as spare.At its core, Parappa is a timeline with timing marks on it. An icon travels along the timeline and when it is over certain segments, it prompts you to press a button. That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s the game. When the icon reaches a certain point on the timeline, a timeline that corresponds with the beat of the music, you press a preselected button. You can play around with other buttons at different points on the timeline, but the game really only requires you to press a button at that one particular moment.All of the things that videogames are known for, freedom of movement, improvisation, variable interactivity, those aren&rsquo;t required in PaRappa. Just press the button when you are asked to and the game will be satisfied.Now, you can improvise, and you can play with the beat outside of the required hits, and the game will reward you for that, but you don&rsquo;t need to. You can just hit the beats, and you will progress.If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with rhythm games, I can imagine that this description doesn&rsquo;t sound very fun. You&rsquo;re right. It shouldn&rsquo;t be. But it is.Maybe that shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising. After all, playing music is fun. In some ways, a game like PaRappa turns the PlayStation controller into a musical instrument. When you hit a button the game will make a corresponding sound and it is up to you then to make those sounds rhythmic. The game is asking you to do the fun part.There is another aspect of PaRappa the Rapper that I should probably touch on. It&rsquo;s the part that most commentary on the game would probably get to first. PaRappa is completely unhinged.The game plays out in a series of animated skits populated by a cast of paper thin characters. Each skit concluding with a song for you to play along with.The skits typically involve the title character, PaRappa the Rapper, rapping along to some sort of skill building life event. Learning Karate, taking a driving test, learning to bake. It&rsquo;s all very simple and silly, but every aspect of the game is painted with levels of bizarre and surreal. Character dialog is often nonsensical. Line deliveries are spectacularly odd. Considered motivations are usually nonexistent. In PaRappa&rsquo;s world things happen simply because things happen. You just have to go with the flow, and, as you are constantly reminded, you &lsquo;gotta believe&rsquo;.The packaging of this very simple gameplay loop is lively and odd and perfectly charming. If rhythm games needed a kickstart, PaRappa was designed to deliver.Now, decades later, PaRappa doesn&rsquo;t really compete with the Rock Bands and Guitar Heros of the world, but it is still a very special game. As goofy as it is challenging and without a doubt, one of the best games.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWork continues slowly, but slowly, on my 2D pixel art game that is neither 2D nor pixel art.&nbsp;I redesigned and rebuilt the player character model and started the process of rigging it for animation.This game is going to be a strange looking thing. Like an alternate history version of a Capcom CP System game where they put in support for colored lighting, shadow casting, and 16x9 displays. A real chimera of the old and the new.I also started on (restarted really) level and environment design. A lot of the things I didn&rsquo;t think I would be able to get away with, It turns out I can, as long as I manage any moving objects with a little piece of code I wrote that keeps everything snapped to perfect screen pixels.There are a lot of pixelation shaders out there that crunch polygons and textures down to strictly paletted pixels but there is no fooling anyone if the models still move like they are 3D objects. Spinning, moving too smoothly, antialiasing in sub pixels, or picking up specific specular highlights. They can be 3D objects, but they have to move like they have the limitations of sprites.When I first tested the animation, I found that making some very crisp, pose to pose, animations without a lot of in-betweening looked pretty good, but it was missing something.When I finally figured out what the problem was it seemed pretty obvious. What I needed to do was to make a set of very fixed poses and then do a small handful of tweens, but with no real timing between them. So no held frames would be baked into the animation. Instead, I used the game engine to pull the frames one at a time when they were called for the specific animation. Running for instance might be 6 or 7 frames. But rather than just play &ldquo;run&rdquo; as a complete animation, I found that I would call each frame based on the speed or direction of player input. Speeding up or slowing down the animation the way you normally would added some extra smoothing and mush that looked every inch a 3D model pretending to be a 2D sprite. Calling on each frame in the sequence as needed, looked very different. It looks more like 2D animation.It shouldn&rsquo;t be shocking at all, since that&rsquo;s more or less the procedure you would use to animate a game character circa 1990. Sometimes the old tricks can be the new tricks, only with colored lighting, collision physics, and shadow casters.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI know it&rsquo;s a cliche line to say that there is always more than one way to accomplish anything. I think that might be especially true for computer graphics. Of course, there are as many paths and processes to creating something like a painting as there are people who paint them, but you would think that with a system as rigid and, literally binary, as a computer, that there would be some processes that can only be done in one way.I have a recent example. I am trying to achieve an effect, something sort of like feathers or the little strips of paper dangling in layers from a pinata. Over the course of a few hours I discovered about a dozen ways to do that. Some of them are existing, even old by computer graphics standards, techniques. Some of them are combinations of strategies. A couple I came up with and for all I know they are completely novel.Some of them are purely geometry based. Just manipulation of triangles. Some of them are combinations of geometry and shader programs written to run extremely quickly on a computer&rsquo;s GPU. A couple are purely image based, using layers of textures. The best ones for my purposes are probably combinations of all of these. Not one of them is the wrong or right choice. They all have their tradeoffs.&nbsp;I have thought many times over the years of getting a job teaching 3D modelling or animation. I have even applied a few times. I was once offered a job almost on the spot to teach a 3D course, but I turned it down. I didn&rsquo;t think the school&rsquo;s curriculum really aligned with the way I think digital art should be taught. There is not just one way to create anything, and there is not just one way to teach it.I think that might be my problem. I have been doing computer graphics a long time, and I can see so many potential paths. Trying to tell someone new to it that there is a right way to do anything, or that they should try to do things the way that I do them just seems so wrong. Wrong and possibly harmful. People should work the way that works for them. But that also means that you need to try a bit of everything, be a generalist, before you know what does and doesn&rsquo;t work for you.Should a person new to, say, 3D modelling start by sculpting, hard low polygon modelling one vertex at a time, work orthographic or in perspective? I don&rsquo;t know. I have a lot of tools in my arsenal at this point, but mostly, I know that I don&rsquo;t know everything. I don&rsquo;t have that self assured bravado that someone might need to walk into a classroom and declare that they know the path to getting you from zero to 3D artist in a few months. I know too much to think that I know that much.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - The Irritating MazeThe Irritating Maze is not a complex game. It is not a game that defines or extends a genre. You will not find a compelling narrative or ingenious mechanics here. The Irritating Maze is simple. But it&rsquo;s the right kind of simple.The Irritating maze is the most pure sort of game there is. A test of skill.When you start you get to choose from a wide selection of playable characters. Either Man or Lady. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter, though, because the game plays identically no matter who you choose.After that, you guide the tip of a metal rod through an electrified maze filled with hazards. That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s the game. Guide what amounts to a round cursor through a maze. Don&rsquo;t touch the walls. Then do it again. Then again. Win.But you probably won&rsquo;t win. The Irritating Maze might be simple in concept and design, but it is ridiculously hard to play. There are only three levels, but just making it halfway through the second one is an accomplishment. Some of the hazards are truly devious. Parts of the maze move, there are rapidly moving wheels, and at one point the game traps you in a small box, and then moves the box around. Sinister.&nbsp;Released to arcades by SNK in 1997 without much fanfare and based on a mid 90s Japanese variety show segment that very few people in North America and Europe would have been familiar with, it&rsquo;s no wonder that The Irritating Maze is not a very well known game. Maybe you will just have to trust me then, that this game is so perfectly executed that it&rsquo;s amazing it didn&rsquo;t spawn a wave of copycats and sequels.The Irritating Maze is one of the few Neo Geo arcade games of the time to be built into a special cabinet. It used a trackball controller and sported an air cannon that would blast air in the players face when they collided with one of the walls. I suppose that incorporating a metal trackball that would actually shock the player would have been a lawyer's nightmare, so they went with the air cannon. Probably a safer choice. Still, the game starts with a warning that any person who is pregnant or has a heart condition should not play The Irritating Maze.Maybe they should have put that on the cabinet in bright glowing letters. We would probably be playing The Irritating Maze 15 today if they had.There is a place in this world for wild dynamic systems based games and vast arrays of player verbs, but sometimes, sometimes, you just want to move carefully through a maze.That makes The Irritating Maze one of the Best Games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI only have one more story to write for the &lsquo;write one short story every weekend jam type thing&rsquo; that I have been doing.I will be glad to be done, since it is slightly stressful coming up with something new every weekend and then having a bunch of strangers judge it and pick it apart. On the other hand, it is pretty fun to push yourself and just see what you are capable of coming up with. And maybe it&rsquo;s even a little fun to have a bunch of strangers pick apart your work, while you pick apart theirs. The hope is That in the end any story that comes out of this process will be that much better. You have passed that first draft, first read hurdle, and you can really try to send it.I still find that writer's block is not a thing. At least not for me. I can pretty easily come up with a handful of story ideas for any given prompt, toss out all the really bad ones and run with the sort of okay one that I have left over.&nbsp;It usually takes me a couple of hours of jotting notes and stray lines to come up with something approaching cohesive, but coming up with new story ideas or scenes, or characters, or situations. That&rsquo;s not really a problem.That doesn&rsquo;t mean that I write fast though. Many people in the competition would write a couple of stories and choose the one they liked best. A weekend is just enough time for me to write one sub 1000 word story and polish it up to any sort of presentable state. If I thought I had a few thousand words to work with, maybe I would write faster. Long dialog scenes or detailed action scenes. Stuff that can really get away from you if you have no hard word cap to deal with. That&rsquo;s that sort of stuff that can really flow out of you when you get going. Or, to be more specific, If I really get going. I don&rsquo;t know how you write. Maybe you are one of those fast people.Over the past year, I have only finished a couple of stories. I have two that are on the verge of done, and another two that need a bit of work but are otherwise humming along fine. But, like I said, I don&rsquo;t write fast. I like to take some time and consider words and phrases. Try on different ways to describe things. Rewrite a single sentence 7 or 8 or 25 times until I get it just right.I do think that, for the most part, my stories this year are better, or more workable than last year. It&rsquo;s tough for me to judge. I think I have less trouble getting them out, at any rate.Well, it&rsquo;s time I submit my story for this week. Wish me luck.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tQuite a few months ago, I bought the full Affinity suite of products. Before you ask, of course they were on sale.&nbsp;I have used Affinity Designer for a few years now, but up until recently, I haven&rsquo;t had much reason to use Affinity Photo. I use Krita for most of my painting and image editing, and I still like it, but recently I have been working on my IPad more and more often. Drawing and painting directly on the screen has its advantages. Since Serif offered a single licence for Windows, Mac, and IOS, doing some image editing and painting in Affinity Photo was sort of a no-brainer.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s fantastic.So I was a Photoshop and Illustrator guy. I used them both for almost twenty years. Professionally. I can honestly say that there are a lot of reasons that I prefer the Affinity suite. And no, it&rsquo;s not just the price.&nbsp;Having pretty much the full toolset on the iPad is great. That I can use the same file on IPad and desktop is phenomenal. And, for the most part, the non-destructive tools are at least on par with Adobe&rsquo;s, if not better. Compound masks are a must have for me now.I think they may have a little way to go with their brush engine, but I have been able to paint most of what I want to with very few issues or problems.The vector tools are solid, and if I ever find them lacking it&rsquo;s pretty easy to hop over to Designer and build out a mask or text.If Photo has some decent vector tools, then it shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising that Designer has some decent raster tools. Pixel paint brushes and patterns that an Illustrator artist would kill for.I used to promote Affinity Designer, because I used it nearly every day, but now, after using both Designer and Photo extensively, I can easily say it might be worth it for you to switch from Adobe products.Until something much better comes along, I will happily continue paying the very low upgrade price for the Affinity suite of products.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Money Puzzle Exchanger / Money Idol ExchangerIf you're like me, you think about Magical Drop 3 more than a person really should. Almost immediately after thinking about Magical Drop 3, you think of Money Puzzle Exchanger. It turns out, Face, the developer of Money Puzzle Exchanger, might be like me.The similarities between Money Puzzle Exchanger and Magical Drop are maybe what you might call legally actionable. Both games play very similarly. Circles that march down from the top of the screen and you as the player have the ability to grab one, or a similar group of those circles, pull them down to the bottom, move them to a new column and fire them back up to the top. If you make certain combinations of circles touch at the top, they will clear, or in the case of Money Puzzle Exchanger, they will be replaced by a circle of a different value.That&rsquo;s the biggest difference here. In Magical Drop, making a line of three or more of the same color bubble will cause those bubbles, and any other similarly colored bubble touching them, to pop. In Money Puzzle Exchanger those circles represent coins and matching, say, five coins with a one on them will convert them all into a single coin with a value of five. Two fives make a ten, five tens makes a fifty, two fifties makes a hundred, and five hundreds makes a five hundred. Match two five hundreds and they will disappear, clearing them from the board permanently.While that all sounds sort of straight forward, imagine trying to make several matching patterns like that at high speed. Magical Drop can be difficult, but matching colors is trivial compared to that.On the surface, the gameplay of these two games might seem extremely similar, so similar that Data East may have sued Face over it, the experience of playing Money Puzzle Exchanger is very different from Magical Drop. There is so much more strategy and planning involved. The action is not as fast paced, but maybe even more hectic. More mentally stressful. In a good way.For a moment I thought that Money Puzzle Exchanger might have the wackier cast of fun characters, but they both post up a good showing in that department.So, Money Puzzle Exchanger is a lot like Magical Drop. And that&rsquo;s great. But it also plays differently, and maybe is a bit more difficult. And that&rsquo;s also great.It&rsquo;s a lot like one of the other best games, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s disqualifying. Money Puzzle Exchanger is different enough that I think it stands on its own as one of the best games.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tEvery once in a while, I come across a game that I just don&rsquo;t get. I can&rsquo;t understand why other people enjoy it. This is very much a &lsquo;not for me&rsquo; thing. I mean, go enjoy whatever games you like, I&rsquo;m not going to tell you no, or tell you that you are wrong for liking it.Almost always, I come across these games because someone recommended it to me. Or someone wrote an article about it. Or they talked glowingly about it on a podcast or YouTube video. Because they like it. They enjoyed it. And then I try it, and I don&rsquo;t.The common public reaction seems to be to tell everyone who likes that thing, that they are wrong for liking it. I don&rsquo;t and can&rsquo;t subscribe to that. I know that there are things that I like that other people won&rsquo;t. Usually I can try to articulate why it is that I like that thing, but I don&rsquo;t actually expect my opinion to sway anyone.There are legions of games, and I won&rsquo;t attempt to name them here, that I don&rsquo;t enjoy, but I can imagine how someone else might. There is a much shorter list of games that I have a lot of trouble understanding who they are for. And yet, these games still have their proponents.I recently played a game, that I won&rsquo;t name here, that came highly recommended.&nbsp; There are even some people out there calling it potentially their game of the year.I&rsquo;m baffled. I played it. I think I explored it fully. I think I played enough to see what other people see in it&hellip; and I&rsquo;m baffled. I hated almost every bit of playing it.No, the kids are not wrong. This is just something that is very much not for me. And that&rsquo;s okay.&nbsp;I truly hope that the person for whom this is their game of the year, enjoyed every second of their time with it. I will be playing something else. There are so very many games to choose from.\t\t"

Rocks.Big rocks, little rocks, medium sized rocks that split into two smaller rocks. Rocks and void. The way it started. The way it was always going to end.Asteroids may have started as a way to create a single player Space War experience but it ended up as so much more.Asteroids may be the first real test of endurance for a video game. Several games had unending waves of enemies. Space Invaders is all about unending waves of enemies. But Space Invaders offers the player a shield to hide behind. Reprieve from the continuous assault of descending invaders. A moment to blink. Asteroids never lets up. There is always another rock to destroy or be destroyed by.&nbsp;Asteroids, while initially less challenging than something like Space Invaders, quickly ramps to test your perception and reflexes. The rocks drift smoother than any other game at the time. Your ship reacts with a realistic momentum and inertia. If you let it get away from you just trying to drive the ship will kill you faster than any rock out there.Occasionally a saucer will zip across the screen taking pot shots at you, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter, your real nemesis is the rocks. All of the rocks.It&rsquo;s Asteroids, you fight rocks, it&rsquo;s one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tOne of my favorite game experiences this year was the surprise of Hi-Fi Rush, a rhythm stylish action combat game that was as unexpectedly funny and charming as it was fun to play.I say unexpectedly because, when I saw the first trailer for the game I did blurt, out loud to no one &lsquo;Fuck off!&rsquo;. The first line spoken in the trailer, right after the requisite pause and record scratch is &ldquo;Yep, that&rsquo;s me.&rdquo; A trailer moment so cliche that it is constantly parodied. I was almost certain that this moment was a portent of awful things. Even if the game played well, the writing was sure to drive me away. I am glad to say that I was very wrong.There is a sort of winking self awareness in some writing that rings completely false. A style of writing that lets you know that the writer considers the content and characters worthy of ridicule. The writer wants the audience to know that they are smarter than the material. Above it. Almost no one likes this style of writing.Recently, this has led to a lot of internet chatter about Marvel and Star Wars movies and Whedonesque dialog. Now you can say what you want about Joss Whedon as a person, and his output as a writer, but a solid majority of the detractors are simply wrong. Quippy, snarky, irreverent dialog is not always bad dialog. If it&rsquo;s true to the character and true to the moment, it&rsquo;s not bad dialog. You might not like it, but hey there are lots of things you might not like, but nothing about that makes them objectively bad. Being snarky at the expense of the character or the reality of the moment might be.Here&rsquo;s the problem. There have been a lot of shows, movies, plays, games, comic books, and novels written that try to play with that light, irreverent style, but they do that at the expense of the truth of the characters. Hi-Fi Rush loves its characters and wants you to love them too.The game&rsquo;s main character, Chai, is an idiot, and the writers are very aware of this, but he never says or does anything just for the joke. Other characters comment on him being an idiot, but not for the joke. The spirit of the joke isn&rsquo;t mean or opportunistic. It&rsquo;s just true. And funny.&nbsp;The dialog in Hi-Fi Rush is quippy, snarky, and irreverent, but never at the expense of the characters or the truth of the moment. The world of Hi-Fi Rush is goofy and light and fun, but when it needs to be honest or heartfelt there really is no tonal shift that takes place. Honesty is where the game always is. It&rsquo;s goofy, but there is no indication that the writers think that the game is dumb or bad or lesser than. The writing is always fully honest and fully earnest. Because of that, it is also very funny.Maybe someone thought it would be fun to start the trailer in that cliched way. Maybe they were so fully invested in the story that they didn&rsquo;t realize that the trailer could be interpreted as punching down at the characters or story. Maybe different people wrote and created the trailer. Not an uncommon practice.&nbsp;Hi-Fi Rush is very funny. But it&rsquo;s also very earnest. It&rsquo;s silly, but it&rsquo;s heartfelt.The internet at large might want claim to be over snarky, self aware writing, but I think what they are actually done with is dishonest writing. Writing that doesn&rsquo;t take the world or characters seriously. Writing that doesn&rsquo;t love its subject. After all, if the writers don&rsquo;t love their characters, why should we.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI&rsquo;ve been working on a 2D game project for a little while now. You might say I have been working on this project since the early 90s.I have always been fascinated by video games. Since the time I was probably three and played a Space Wars arcade machine with my mom in the alcove between a bar and a restaurant, I have been amazed by them. That I can press a button or move a stick or wiggle a mouse or move my hands around in space with a screen strapped to my face, and something deep inside a computer will respond to that input, is pure magic.It&rsquo;s only been very recently that I have been able to make any video games of my own. Nothing about making games has made them any less magical to me. Difficult work, but not less magical. I have modelled, rigged, and animated a character. I chose and painted the colors of that character. I wrote the code that makes that character move around based on inputs that I specified, and it still seems magical.I do program a little, and I know enough of the internals and technicalities of how games work that I can muddle through, but, as you may have guessed, my main area of interest is graphics. I&rsquo;m a 3D artist, with a helping of traditional 2D and illustration on the side, then season all that with some animation. I like to analyze art, partly for the aesthetic, but mostly for the technical processes that it takes to create that art. I find the how more interesting than the why. And I&rsquo;m especially interested in when the how influences the why. I&rsquo;m talking about constraints.The 2D game I am working on has the benefits of a ridiculous amount of graphics and cpu processing power. I am using a 3D engine that is capable of real time lighting and shadowing. One that can change every pixel on a 4K display in a few milliseconds. One that can process millions of polygons into finished images faster than the human eye can follow. And I am trying to make all of that look like an arcade machine several decades old.It&rsquo;s working.I think understanding the constraints, the how, of why older arcade art looked the way it looked, is informing how I aim the vast armada of graphics processing I have available at the problem of achieving that aesthetic. It&rsquo;s not just a matter of using those same tools or techniques, it&rsquo;s a matter of emulating how pixels in those games got drawn to the screen. The hows can determine the whys.There are a lot of pixel art games out there that choose pixel art as an aesthetic, and that&rsquo;s fine. I enjoy looking at an awful lot of them. But they are using that aesthetic in a very loose way. In a way that is determined more by choice than by constraint. I&rsquo;m attempting to work in the other direction. I am using new tools and then placing a constraint on how I use them and letting the constraint determine how the final art will look.That might be a semantic difference, but it&rsquo;s my semantic difference.I&rsquo;m making a new game that looks like an old game, but sort of plays like a new game. And every time I press a button or push a stick, it feels like magic.\t\t"

Both of those stories ended up getting rejected, but one of them was on hold for its third time (fourth maybe, but two of those times were at the same place).&nbsp;I haven&rsquo;t sent that story back out, and I&rsquo;m not sure why. I think I want to have several ready to go at once. It&rsquo;s tough to hang all your hopes on one story, even if you know it&rsquo;s good and you have had several outlets tell you it&rsquo;s good (just not good enough for them right now for whatever reason).&nbsp;I have three stories almost ready to go, but I probably won&rsquo;t have them done until the new year at the rate I write.So I guess that&rsquo;s it. Not much to add for this update. I&rsquo;m still writing&hellip; slowly. I have about eight other stories started, but I have put them all on hold until I finish this first batch.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - SubSpaceIn 1997 you would be lucky to get two computers to talk with one another long enough to play a short game of quake.It wasn&rsquo;t impossible. Networked multiplayer games existed. Lots of people played them. I played them. But they weren&rsquo;t exactly easy to get running. They weren&rsquo;t exactly responsive. They weren&rsquo;t exactly stable. The idea of running a single game that could accommodate over two hundred players on a single server, over a dial up modems, well that was sorcery.Higher speed connections to the internet were available, but they were either extremely expensive or only in specific locales. Wherever you happened to be, that is where high speed internet probably wasn&rsquo;t. It was all a little too big an ask just to play a multiplayer game. If you wanted to do that you would pack up your pc and move it to where you could hook up a LAN. With a bunch of other people. Maybe even a party. A LAN party.Now, if I want to play a game with any number of other people I can turn on one of the many devices within arms reach that will let me do that. Including this IPad I am typing on right now.What if there were some sorcery that let you do that in 1997? What if there was at least one game where you could join in and play with an absolutely staggering amount of people.SubSpace is all at once close to a decade ahead of its time while also being a throwback to the very early days of video games.SubSpace is multiplayer Asteroids. Actually, it might be more accurate to say that SubSpace is massively multiplayer Spacewar!.Spacewar! is a head to head space combat game from the early 60&rsquo;s. You control a spaceship in pitched combat against another spaceship. There is gravity, inertia, explosions, a star you can slingshot your ship around. It&rsquo;s actually pretty impressive. And it is likely the first ever video game.SubSpace is that, but if two hundred other people were also playing and there are missions and team and sometimes you would join up with a bunch of random people from anywhere in the world to play some spaceship soccer.It felt like it shouldn&rsquo;t work, but it did. It was amazing.Unfortunately, being amazing doesn&rsquo;t always mean commercial success. Subspace didn&rsquo;t sell well enough to keep the servers running for very long. And like far too many online games, that would have been the end of it. With no server, the game had nothing to call in to, no place in the world to call home.But SubSpace was amazing, and a lot of people knew that. These people did what people who love something amazing do. They made it their own.Today on Steam you can play SubSpace Continuum. It is a aground up recreation of SubSpace. I don&rsquo;t know if there are people playing it now, but I think it might be worth your while to try. Get a group of two hundred or so people together. Go fly tiny 2D spaceships around 2D mazes and shoot at each other. It&rsquo;s fun. It&rsquo;s one of the Best Games.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tAbout a half an hour ago I solved an issue I have been having with my 2D (but actually 3D) game project. It feels great.When I started this, I had an extremely specific aesthetic and feeling that I wanted to capture. A late 80&rsquo;s to early 90&rsquo;s arcade machine. The first part of the journey&nbsp; was creating a CRT effect. That came together fairly quickly. The next part was making properly looping animations and a system for making them either 3D or 2D rendered sprites. In the end I managed to make them 3D meshes that get rendered in a spritelike manner.After that was control. I wanted analog control that still felt snappy like D-Pad or joystick inputs. I think I have that mostly taken care of, along with a simple, but solid general input component that handles button presses and gamepad or keyboard inputs. I have interaction with colliders and trigger volumes working. Animation trees are mostly ready to go. The only thing that never worked quite like I wanted was the camera.Godot 4 is pretty well known for having camera jitter when trying to create pixel perfect movement and panning. I experienced a lot of it. Eventually I was able to get the player and object movement to be pretty crisp. There wouldn&rsquo;t be very much pixel twitching when you ran the little character around. Background tiles would stay stuck to the simulated phosphors and CRT bloom. Until the camera moved. If it moved slowly, everything looked okay, but as soon as it started moving with any sort of speed things got very twitchy.I did the first thing anyone would do, I looked it up on the internet. I watched tutorials. I snooped around in code off of GitHub. I did the research. There are a lot of people doing pixel art games and a lot of those people are working on pixel perfect cameras. Not one that I found were solving the same problems as me, and a lot of them required so many weird workarounds and caveats that it would be a chore to develop the actual game. I want aesthetic constraints, not arbitrary technical ones.Anyway, at the end of all of that, I combined some techniques and figured out a solution that actually allows me more artistic freedom, and it looks damn near perfect.I could try to explain, but you can just watch this and judge for yourself.&#8203;       \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI have been playing some Atari 50. It&rsquo;s part game, part documentary, part interactive museum highlighting some slices over the 50 year history of Atari.It is packed with high resolution scans of game manuals and marketing materials. Most of them are what you would expect. Flyers filled with details about cabinets for arcade owners to peruse when making purchasing decisions, complete with the requisite amount of hype. I find all of this historical miscellany fascinating. This is the sort of stuff that typically gets tossed, since it doesn&rsquo;t offer much value to the company. Not much money to be made with a flyer for an arcade machine that isn&rsquo;t being produced or sold anymore. It&rsquo;s even more difficult for people to see any value in artifacts created for temporary commercial purposes within their own lifetimes. The first Coca Cola logo ever produced is historically interesting, some slight change to that logo produced in the last five months is not. Maybe it should be. Maybe we should celebrate these small artifacts. Small works.One of the things I have been extremely taken with when playing through Atari 50 is the T-Shirts. T-Shirts come up a lot. Pictures of people wearing weird T-Shirts, stories of people making T-Shirts, and the company using T-Shirts as marketing material. Compared to most corporate T-Shirts today, the design of a lot of these T-Shirts absolutely rips.I&rsquo;ll admit here and now that I haven&rsquo;t done a ton of research on this, but I think there might be a reason these particular T-Shirts are great. Most of these T-Shirts are from the late 70s and early 80s. There was a certain confluence of technologies and design during that time that would lead to some really fantastic T-Shirts.First, screen printing technology, which had been around for literally hundreds of years at the time, had fairly recently been commodified to the point that a person could buy or build a screen printing setup for a few hundred dollars. That meant that it became pretty easy for people to print images and words onto T-Shirts, at least if what you want is fairly basic.Around the same time, graphic design and camera technology was going through a similar commodification. We weren&rsquo;t quite to the point where all of this work could be done on a computer, setting up artwork was still mostly a manual process, but improved photographic film, emulsion, and lithograph materials helped designers work cheaper and quicker than ever before. This led to an absolute boom of high quality design being applied to products that never would have enjoyed such high quality artwork even a decade earlier. Toys and moderately priced consumer products started getting the premium artwork treatment. Artwork that could be resized and reused for anything and everything. Artwork that could be applied cheaply to something like a T-Shirt.Of course, the graphic T-Shirt options somewhere in the vicinity of 1979 were nothing like they are today. You can get a cheap shirt with basically anything you want on it now. You can even have a place print something you drew with your finger in a jack box game and they will send you that shirt in a few days. Maybe even less. But that also means that most shirts are considered cheap, almost disposable, items. Companies that make shirts don&rsquo;t always bring their A game.In the late 70s they had a bunch of good artwork and it was very easy to make T-Shirts. Maybe not as easy as it is today, but if you are silk screening the shirts and not inkjet printing them, it was pretty close. If you are a company like Atari and you want to make some shirts to sell, and maybe promote your company and products, you will use the artwork that you have ready for screen printing. The best artwork your company can make. Simply put, nothing else is ready.Almost all of the T-Shirts I am seeing in Atari 50 follow that model. They are screen prints of some bit of art that the company had already photographed and set up for making screens or plates. In other words, their best art. I&rsquo;m sure they had a few duds, but I haven&rsquo;t seen them.While the flyers and other advertising materials were probably held in a flat file somewhere until they were scanned for this project, I doubt the T-Shirts exist now. T-shirts aren&rsquo;t really known for their durability, but also, people don&rsquo;t tend to consider artifacts like that important. At least not historically important.That&rsquo;s unfortunate, since they represent a lot of skilled artist&rsquo;s work. That, and they were a damn sight better than just another corporate logo in the center of someone&rsquo;s chest.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Retro Game Challenge (GameCenter CX: Arino no Chosenjo)For the last twenty years the show GameCenter CX has played on Fuji TV One in Japan. It&rsquo;s a comedy show where Shinya Arino attempts to play, and beat, old video games. Arino is an affable man, usually quick with a joke, who suffers the task of playing these games at the behest of the CX company, a company that gleefully promotes and demotes him based on his performance in the games, but one that he also appears to run. His assistants will show up to alternately help or torment him, whichever is funnier in the moment.Between games, Arino and his crew tour around Japan interviewing legendary figures in the video game industry, and, more often than not, playing games with them.The entire show is built on good natured enjoyment, and an honest love of video games.&nbsp;When indieszero set out to make a game based on GameCenter CX, the only way to do the show justice would be to build into it that same love. So that is exactly what they did.&nbsp;Since GameCenter CX isn&rsquo;t really a known commodity outside of Japan, the English title of the game was changed to Retro Game Remix, but the content of the game is largely the same.In Retro Game Challenge, you play as a young kid in the 80s, playing with your neighbor on what looks to be a Nintendo Famicom.A low poly version of Arino will issue you challenges, much like he deals with during the show, and you must complete them by playing a series of fictional video games.It would do a disservice to the games included, to call them minigames. The games are often more fully featured than a lot of early Famicom games. They are often ridiculously authentic. If a player weren&rsquo;t familiar with the real games that these fictional facsimiles are referencing, they could fairly easily be confused for real games from the mid to late 80s.The games are good too. They look good. They sound good. They play good. They are good. They aren&rsquo;t just good enough for a minigame collection. They are legitimately enjoyable sans the game master Arino framing device, and arbitrary challenges. Indieszero made games within a game, but they made them so well, many of them could have stood on their own, wrapped in a plastic cartridge and jammed into a Nintendo console.The love for gaming doesn&rsquo;t end with the high quality of the fictional games. Each game comes with a period perfect manual that you can flip through for background and tips on how to best play each game.The manuals are beautifully designed and pitch perfect. There is a deep love that went into the fake packaging of these fake games. They feel real, because they are real.The last threads of the nostalgia tapestry making up Retro Game Challenge, is the magazines. Every once in a while a magazine will be added to your shelf, and you can take it down and read it. The magazines are filled with poorly, but authentically, written reviews, hints, and articles about the games you are, and will be, playing. The magazines provide a sense of place. A connection to the time that these fictional games occupy.Retro Game Challenge loves games just as much as the show it&rsquo;s based on, and that love makes it one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

It often comes as a wonder to many of them that there are people out there that process the world in very different ways. That one person can hold an extremely vivid, three dimensional representation of a tomato in their imagination, while another person can clearly imagine a symbolic representation of the letters in the word tomato with only a tangential connection to what a tomato is or looks like.I imagine that picturing the perfectly realized tomato is what knowing your own art style is like.So I do what so many people with slightly different thought patterns do. I fake it.I have a way that my hand likes to make lines. I have an attraction to certain forms and shapes. I put those into my work and shrug at it. Maybe that&rsquo;s my style. I don&rsquo;t feel like it is, but if other people can look at something I have drawn or sculpted, and recognize that it might have come from me, maybe that&rsquo;s all that having a style is.I watched that artist on YouTube draw a set of portraits. They were all recognizably from the same artist. They did what they said they would do. They adapted those portraits to their own style.Did they just use shapes and arcs that their hand could draw, and continue to reuse shapes that they were attracted to. Maybe, but I don&rsquo;t think so. It seemed like they had a personal style that they had spent time crafting. They chose an aesthetic and they bent all of their art toward it.I can honestly say that I don&rsquo;t know how to do that. I don&rsquo;t know what that is. That tomato doesn&rsquo;t exist for me. I fake it. I make the marks I make and I bend the image in a way that solves the problem I am trying to solve. I adjust proportions, I infer emotion, I attempt to tell a story. If any of that comes out as some sort of cohesive personal style might be for other people to decide. That part of my brain just doesn&rsquo;t work that way. &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI had reason to think recently about the way that art is taught.&nbsp;I think there are a lot of art teachers, instructors, and professors out there that do a fantastic job. You can even find many of them on YouTube or various art instruction channels.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m talking &lsquo;capital A&rsquo; art here. As in, any medium of expression that people use that is not purely informational. Visual art, music, performance, writing, interactive, culinary, fashion, architectural, competitive, martial, etc, etc, etc.&nbsp;There are a thousand and one books on any artistic topic you might be interested in. Dozens of courses offered at an institute of learning near you. Art is our first, and most diverse, form of cultural communication. Art is the difference between loose groups of cave dwelling hominids and globe spanning civilizations. Art is on a very short list of the things that make humans human. And we keep on teaching it to each other wrong.I have written here before about how art isn&rsquo;t a thing you make, it&rsquo;s a thing you do. There are exactly as many ways to do art as there are people. Every single one of us will do the things we do in slightly different ways. We will create our cultural artifacts or express our ephemeral performance arts in slightly different ways than any other person.Art is also an industry, and industry requires some amount of consistency. A level of repeatability. The good thing is that a trained and practiced human is pretty adept at consistency. We are good at creating patterns and repetition. It&rsquo;s in our nature. We build machines and tools that aid in our consistency.The problem is, that sometimes, we mistake the industry and consistency for quality.There is a large contingent of the art instruction world that would like nothing more than to create robots. Individuals that will, when asked, repeat a set of processes to create a consistent, repeatable, product. They think they are teaching art, but they are teaching the creation of artifacts. Art and artifacts are very different things. Artifacts might be what we make, but art is what we do and how we do it.The only way to get better at anything, is through practice. Repetition. No person starts out making their first mark on paper and ends up producing a masterpiece. You have to practice. You have to work through processes. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you only have to practice making that one mark.I suppose it&rsquo;s a mindset more than the actual, physical steps that you have to take. You can, of course, draw seven thousand circles so that you might be better at drawing circles. But that&rsquo;s not all that you learned.In drawing those circles, you learned the arc of your hand. The dexterity of your wrist. You learned the rhythm of movement. The pressure and angle you can apply to graphite. You didn&rsquo;t just make circles. You aren&rsquo;t only good at making circles. You have learned motions and processes that can be applied to drawing any form. You can draw a hip, an ear, a leaf, a stream flowing past a cottage illuminated by moonlight. You didn&rsquo;t only learn to draw circles.There are far too many teachers trying to teach new people to draw new circles so that they can take up positions in the circle drawing industry. These new people will be practiced, they will be consistent, but unless they realize the depth and breadth of what they have learned they will go on thinking that they are quite good at drawing circles, and nothing more.Art is the act of creating.That is the part that needs to be taught.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Shatterhand (Tokky&#363; Shirei Solbrain)By 1991 the last nails were already being driven into the coffin of the NES. The console wouldn't actually be discontinued for years, and in its home market of Japan, a full decade. Games would continue to trickle out during those years (there are still games being made for the old Famicom/Nintendo Entertainment System), but releasing a game for that machine in 1991 was just asking for it to be forgotten.At the tail end of a console's life there are usually only two kinds of games that get released. Weird licensed games and games that started development way earlier but took a long time to reach release. Either way, the results are not usually stellar.Shatterhand is sort of an outlier. It originated as a licensed game based on a Japanese action show. Tokky&#363; Shirei Solbrain or Super Rescue Solbrain was a superhero show where cops wore special high tech armor to fight crime in Tokyo. This is the sort of thing that licensed game dreams are made of. If you want to make some money selling games to kids there are a few things you will need to do. Make something flashy, make it vaguely resemble the show, design and develop it quickly so that it comes out while the show is still relevant. Making the game good usually doesn&rsquo;t factor into these equations. If you can, you just copy another game, a popular game, and you use all of those mechanics in your licensed game. Tokky&#363; Shirei Solbrain does none of that.Actually, that&rsquo;s not entirely true. They did make the game quickly, and it did come out when the show was still on the air, but Tokky&#363; Shirei Solbrain is not a quick flip of some existing game design. It is the height of what the developer, Angel, was capable of making at the time. Nearly a decade into working with the famicom hardware, they made a game that is rock solid, interesting, challenging, beautiful, and, above all, fun. That isn&rsquo;t normal for licensed games.Even if people from Angel or Bandai suspected that they may have a hit on their hands, localizing the game must have been difficult. Obviously, very few people outside of Japan had any reverence for Tokky&#363; Shirei Solbrain. Instead of a basic translation, the developers opted to create Shatterhand, a recreation of the original with new art, a slightly modified story, and some new level designs. Playing them back to back, I would even say that Shatterhand plays a bit nicer. Smoother. Better.The game is, as the English name would suggest, all about punching. Unlike Mega Man your attack range is the length of your arm. That means that playing Shatterhand feels a lot more timing based and visceral. There is an immediacy to all your actions that just feels great to play.You do have more than your fists to get you through the game. Shatterhand also has one of the most innovative upgrade systems I think I have ever seen. You collect Greek lettered power ups, either Alpha or Beta. When you collect three of them they combine to activate a satellite robot. Depending on the order you collected them, you will get a different helper, with different abilities. Trying them all out and finding which ones are the most useful for each stage offers a whole range of exploration that action games of this type just don&rsquo;t have. To top that, if you collect two sets of the same robot helper in rapid succession, they will turn into a super armor that will give you enhanced abilities for a short while.There are a lot of reasons that Shatterhand shouldn&rsquo;t exist. It was released too late in its console&rsquo;s life. It was a remake of a Japanese licensed game. It bucks convention for the type of platform action game that it is.This is a game that should never have seen a North American release, and yet, here it is. Claiming its place as one of the Best Games.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

You can get right up to the edge of that. You can have the look almost perfect, but if it&rsquo;s not perfect it&rsquo;s difficult to move forward.The pixel look I am going for is like 95% right now, and I think I probably need it around 97% or 98% before I can really let loose on the artwork. It doesn&rsquo;t seem that much does it, that 2 or 3 percent. It&rsquo;s almost nothing.I have done some work on the collision interactions and the animation pipeline. All of that is going fine. It&rsquo;s drawing the pixels to the screen that need a tiny boost.I have a very promising filtering shader on the go. I have a camera adjustment script that keeps things from looking twitchy. Maybe, just maybe, one of those will be the solution to my problem.I literally have the shader open in another window while I type this and I keep jumping over there to make changes.I trust that I will be able to shove this project that extra 2 or 3 percent, but to do that I will need to get back to it. So I guess I will.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Treasure of TarminThe Intellivision video game console started development in 1977. The state of consumer processors in 1977 wasn&rsquo;t really geared toward high fidelity gaming experiences. A lot of arcade machines of the time were still black and white and the most common video game that the public was familiar with was Pong. Pong isn&rsquo;t a bad game, but no one would describe it as deep or dynamic.&nbsp;The core of the machine was a CP1610. This was an update to a processor that was already close to a decade old at that point. CPUs in the &lsquo;70s didn&rsquo;t advance at the pace that they do now, but this wasn&rsquo;t exactly state of the art hardware.The good thing about any computer hardware is that it is always more capable than it seems at first glance. Given enough time and energy, people will come up with all sorts of interesting ways to use a processor or pool of memory. Things that seem impossible become common. Operations that used to take seconds are refined to the point that they happen before a CRT screen can draw the next frame.There are limits, of course. You can&lsquo;t run Doom on an Intellivision. Still, the games released in the early &lsquo;80s bear very little resemblance to the games released at launch. Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Treasure of Tarmin seems like it shouldn&rsquo;t even exist on the same platform. It&rsquo;s astounding.Treasures of Tarmin is the second AD&amp;D game for the Intellivision. The first is a fairly basic, but fun, roguelike. Now I can&rsquo;t be sure if it takes any inspiration from Rogue, or if both games are simply dipping into the same Dungeons and Dragons well. Either could be true. In any case, Treasure of Tarmin does a much better job with the material. Both were made by the same single developer, Tom Loughry.Treasures of Tarmin is a sprawling, first person, adventure game where you will have to explore dungeons, battle a legion of different monsters, collect and manage a fairly intricate yet intuitive inventory, and level up your weapons and items. It defies belief that this one guy was able to pack that much into a cartridge that couldn&rsquo;t fit a JPEG. And a pretty small one at that.&nbsp;I could attempt to describe the game, but you already know what it is. Imagine wandering around a meandering dungeon, picking up items and using them to smite skeletons, goblins, and the like. You know, D&amp;D stuff.It would be a few years before a game like Legend of Zelda would come along to advance console adventure gaming. For the most part, I imagine that developers simply didn&rsquo;t think that it was possible. To create a wide ranging, dynamic adventure you needed the memory, processing, and storage space of a full blown personal computer. And they wouldn&rsquo;t be wrong. There are very few outliers like Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Treasure of Tarmin. It&rsquo;s surprisingly deep and fully featured.This was an early 80s game made on late 70s hardware, and it can still manage to surprise all these decades later.AD&amp;D Treasure of Tarmin is one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tRecently, I tried drawing on actual paper. I mean, this isn&rsquo;t a new thing. I used to draw on paper. I still scratch things out on paper all the time. Just rough notepad sketches when I&rsquo;m testing out an idea or figuring out a shape. But I never actually draw on paper anymore. Not proper drawing. Not something I want to finish. It feels a little strange.I used to draw on paper all the time. Like actually all the time. I spent years doing it. I bought special pencils for drawing. Then, when I realized I liked different pencils better, I bought those instead. Then I bought boxes of entirely different pencils, because these new ones turned out to be so much more to my liking. I tended toward the blue and red ones. Pencils with just the right amount of pigment and wax so the lines could stay sharp when I wanted and flow when I tilted my hand just so.I bought special paper too. Paper with just the right amount of tooth and snap. Paper that wasn&rsquo;t too white, wasn&rsquo;t too thin. Paper that matched my style of drawing. Whatever I thought that was.When I recently went to draw on paper, I couldn&rsquo;t even find my pencils. I had become so divorced from the act of drawing on paper that the tools to do the job weren&rsquo;t nearby.My IPad pencil is literally right in front of me as I type this.I still draw all the time. I draw at the very least several times a week. Some weeks it&rsquo;s every day. But all of my drawing is done on a computer or a tablet. All of my drawing is done digitally.I can imagine that there is some loss of romance to that. The act of putting pencil to paper should mean something. Making actual physical marks on real paper. Spreading molecules of tinted medium across plant fibres in a way that is permanent. In a way that will probably outlive me. That should mean something, right?I found my pencils and I sketched in a sketch book. What I discovered is that I didn&rsquo;t feel it. Whatever caveman part of my brain that should respond to the act of physical drawing, I didn&rsquo;t have it.Drawing digitally, with a glowing screen and an electronic pencil feels just as natural to me now as using graphite&hellip; or whatever is stuffed inside these really great pencils that I have.It didn&rsquo;t feel bad when I drew on paper. It just didn&rsquo;t seem to matter. What I craved was the result. I want the smooth mark created by the arc my wrist and arm. I want the illusion of dimensionality created in a flat image. I want the soft gradient I make when I vary the pressure of my hand and the speed of my movement. I want the result and the process, but I don&rsquo;t have any particular affinity toward how I go about that.Digital is fine by me. As long as that&rsquo;s an option, I&rsquo;ll probably continue to draw that way.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tAn update from the writing front. I only have one story out for submission as I type this (though when you read this, it will probably be at least two). So that isn&rsquo;t great. But I did enter a new story writing contest, so that&rsquo;s a bit better.&nbsp;Story writing contests are a bit weird.I don&rsquo;t actually care that much about how my story places in the contest. I am more concerned with the motivation and the deadline.This contest is a Halloween-ish thing with no particular theme, but you are given two prompts that can be fairly abstract. Each person entering the contest will be provided prompts by another entrant. They can be a word, a phrase, a picture, sort of whatever. There should be a fairly wild array of stories that spawn from this format.We all have one month to write a story under 5000 words. After that, we all review the stories, choose our favourites, and rank them.Maybe when I&rsquo;m done writing I will write here what my prompts were. Maybe.No matter what happens, I win, because I will have a new story at the end of everything. At least that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s supposed to happen. If I actually get this story done remains to be seen.Based on the prompts I got, this story might be a little heavy. Not because the prompts were heavy, but what they made me think of is. So really, I suppose that&rsquo;s on me, and not the prompts.I took a few minutes out of writing that story to write this post. Maybe I should get back to the story.&#8203;\t\t"

That shot was from the old version of the game.This one is from the new version.         I can imagine that most people won&rsquo;t see much difference between the two. Sure, the background is different, and the character looks a little different, the second one isn't so horrifically zoomed in, but other than that it probably doesn&rsquo;t look like much has changed.The first image is entirely 2D. The images are sprites layered one on top of the other. The second image is a blend of 2D textures and 3D models.Getting to this point hasn&rsquo;t been easy, and I can guess that some folks might not understand why I made the change in the first place.I have spent a lot of years learning how to create art and animation in 3D and I know there are a few things that I can get away with if I work in 3D. The only problem here is I want this game to have a certain 2D retro look. So that means making 3D look like 2D.While that might generally be considered more difficult than just working in 2D from the start, I decided that the benefits were worth it.My hope is that this game looks weird. That people who play it won&rsquo;t be able to decide what is going on with it. Is it an old 2D arcade game? Is it a modern 3D game?If I do everything right, it will be both, and neither. With a bit of luck, it will look interesting.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Elevator Action ReturnsElevator Action is a classic arcade game from 1983, where you play as a spy infiltrating an office tower. Your mission involves ascending that tower to search for secret documents, and that will require the use of a lot of elevators. All the while, patrolling enemies will attempt to thwart your efforts. You have a few ways to fight them, but using the elevators against them is probably the most fun. It&rsquo;s a great game.That&rsquo;s not the game I&rsquo;m writing about here.In 1994, Taito released the sequel, Elevator Action Returns.Eleven years and many generations of computer technology later, Elevator Action Returns is as much a leap ahead as it is a throwback. It looks every bit a 1994 arcade game. Great character art, fantastic animation, gameplay action spread over beautiful levels that change dynamically. It looks that way, but it plays very much like a tuned up version of the original. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it plays great, but so did the original.Had this sequel been made any sooner, it just wouldn&rsquo;t have been the same. This is a dream remake of a game.When you play Elevator Action Returns, you can kind of imagine what was going on in the developer&rsquo;s heads. It&rsquo;s like they wanted to make the version of the game they remembered. The game they imagined in their childhood reveries. In place of the tiny, blocky spy character from Elevator Action, they imagined a trio of anime inspired action heroes. In place of the building, a set of sprawling levels in a continuous campaign. In place of the replicated, fedora wearing enemies from the original, they created a whole army of enemies with different looks, behaviours, and attacks.Older video games didn&rsquo;t look very good. We can just accept that as fact. The resolution and color palettes of most games left a lot to the player&rsquo;s imaginations. Characters and locations were representational glyphs, at best. When you play them, your brain sort of fills in the blanks. Making a sequel to a beloved game over a decade later, some things can remain the same, but others will require some translation. Elevator Action Returns is like the real working model based off the Elevator Action sketch. Similar, but fully realized.The elevators are still elevators. They go up and down, but that&rsquo;s not all that they are for. It&rsquo;s not long before you are using them not just to travel the various buildings, but as strategic weapons against an array of terrorist baddies.You probably won&rsquo;t even play a full level before you are waiting for just the right moment to roll a barrel down on top of a group of enemies, lighting them all on fire, or tossing a grenade into an empty shaft to light a completely different group of enemies on fire. In no time, the motion of the elevators becomes your plaything.Some reviews at the time of Elevator Action Returns release weren&rsquo;t particularly kind. There were some sentiments that the game was too simple, or not up to the level of its contemporaries. By 1994, the trend toward 3D was in full swing, and punched up versions of older game mechanics were very much not in fashion. Oddly enough, had the sequel been made even later, the reception for it may have been warmer.Now, Elevator Action Returns is pretty universally recognized as a lost gem. A game that did what it was intending to do so well that some many people missed out on it at the time. The only problem is, most people never really got around to playing it.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a sequel. It&rsquo;s a remake. It&rsquo;s a reimagining of what might have been, had the technology been available eleven years earlier.Elevator Action Returns is one of the Best Games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\t&#8203;Everything I have ever learned about logo design, I learned by tracing.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve dealt with a lot of logos. I&rsquo;ve probably only designed a few. More than ten, less than twenty, maybe. Might be more, but not a ton more. The amount of logos I have dealt with, I couldn&rsquo;t even begin to count. And so very many of those I traced.When you work in advertising or sign design (which, I suppose, is usually advertising too), you will get handed a lot of artwork. Companies will have existing designs and logos that they want put on whatever it is they have you making for them. From single page leaflets to magazine layouts to dimensional signs to enormous carvings to vehicle wraps to television commercials to full motion video billboards. The mediums and modes that advertising artwork can take are uncountable and ever expanding. Someone will hand you some artwork made with one of those mediums in mind and ask you to make it work on any of the others. All too often, that will mean recreating the artwork for that particular medium. You can, and will, ask them if they have their artwork in all the formats that you need. Most of the time they will say &lsquo;no&rsquo;, and send you a grainy jpeg sized for a letterhead, but what they need is a banner, or something that can look nice on the side of a bus.Here is a common example of what I mean. Imagine that you are asked to make a set of stickers from that grainy jpeg. There are a lot of ways to make stickers.&nbsp;You can print stickers onto some sticky backed surface, like paper or vinyl. The printer that you use might be something akin to the inkjet or laser printers that you are accustomed to, but it will likely not use the same type of ink. Industrial printers are made for industrial applications, and every printer uses a slightly different sort of ink and even sets of inks for the same printer can be slightly different. At the very least, the color of the artwork might have to change so that it can be properly reproduced by the printer.&nbsp;You could also use a thermal transfer printer that uses cartridges of specific colored films. Very durable, but much difficult to use. Using a thermal printer usually means that the artwork will have to be in a vector format or converted to a vector format. If the artwork that you have is that grainy jpeg, it will have to be rebuilt.&nbsp;Often, a sticker can be simply cut from the appropriate color vinyl. No printing necessary. That also means that the artwork needs to be converted to vector. Machines that drive cutting knives have no idea about color or pixels. They want paths to follow. You will have to redraw that artwork as a vector, AKA trace that thing.Some artwork is pretty easy to trace. Others, not so much. But tracing, what has to be literally hundreds of logos, can teach you a lot about what makes a good logo. And what doesn&rsquo;t.You become accustomed to repeated shapes and recurrent arcs. Certain ways of composing and balancing.I think you could go to art school, study design, attend classes and lectures put on by the best designers in the world, and you still wouldn&rsquo;t learn as much as you would by cleaning up or adapting artwork. Tracing.Tracing artwork, especially using vector tools, requires that you break down the original design process. You have to reverse engineer it. You have to understand how it was made in the first place.Am I a master logo designer? No, probably not. But I did design this. I think it&rsquo;s pretty good.         It&rsquo;s balanced. There is a flow to it. You could scale it up to the size of a banner fairly easily, or cut it out with a vinyl plotter or cnc router, minus the glow effects of course. It could be a sticker or printed on clothing. I'm pretty certain it could be built from real neon or the led equivalent.The only way I get from shaky legged art student to designing that with some confidence, is by tracing. A lot.There is your permission. Go and trace some artwork, and improve your own skills in the process.&nbsp;\t\t"

I wanted a touch of North American, a touch of European, and a touch of Japanese in the style. A game that could have spawned from that arcade, console, and micro-computer soup.

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Dead ConnectionThe attract mode for Dead Connection opens with a screen that says Taito Film Presents. So far as I can tell there was never an official division of Taito called Taito Film. That fictional declaration helps to set the tone. This won&rsquo;t be the usual arcade action fare. Aliens, zombies, monsters, you aren&rsquo;t going to find any of those here. Dead Connection borrows from a lot of sources, not the least of which are the historical crime dramas Untouchables and the Godfather. Gesturing toward film makes sense. This is a game that oozes cinematic style. That is far from being the most interesting thing about Dead Connection.Dead Connection is set in 1953 in a big city somewhere. It says so in the opening titles. The game drapes itself in a film noir, gangster pastiche. Nothing about it is realistic or properly historical. It is, at times, anachronistic and overly cliche. But that&rsquo;s okay. This is a fanciful take on the crime and revenge genres. More than that though, more than any of the trappings, Dead Connection is a game. The way it plays matters more than the way it presents itself. And it plays like no other game I know.There are plenty of games where you direct a character to walk toward enemies and punch them. There are even more where you use some sort of weapon to shoot at enemies. There are games where you can interact with the background, and there are games where you can dodge and dive for cover. Dead Connection combines all of these, and it did so at a time when that didn&rsquo;t happen. Games did one or two things very well. Or at least they tried to. Games didn&rsquo;t try to incorporate multiple overlapping systems. Dead Connection is a piece of gaming history that is both obvious, and well ahead of its time.I&rsquo;ll attempt to explain why.There were a few run and gun character shooting games made previous to Dead Connection&rsquo;s release in 1992. Okay, more than a few. Literally hundreds of games had you controlling a character who runs around the screen and shoots at enemies. There were even a couple of games like Cabal, and Blood Bros. where you can dive and dodge enemy fire. It&rsquo;s possible that Dead Connection took some inspiration from those games. There are a handful of games where they will give the player a certain amount to auto aim, inferring your intentions from simple directional and button inputs. Maybe Dead Connection is aping those games. There are even games that offer a variety of interactions with background elements in the levels using the same simple, context-sensitive, controls. It could be that Dead Connection is trying to be like one of those games.&nbsp;Maybe. But Dead Connection is all of those things. All at once. The wild amount of potential interactions is staggering. You can set parts of each stage on fire. You can destroy almost everything in various ways, and they will display different levels of destruction depending on what happens to them. Cover comes and goes dynamically. You can hit the deck and enter buildings to hide behind walls. You can climb stairs and ladders to take the high ground, and you can lay prone behind a vehicle until it blows up. There are switches and doors. Glass that shatters. Chandeliers that can come crashing to the ground.In 1992, arcade games simply did not have this level of interactivity. They just didn&rsquo;t. And, as it turns out, they never would. Games like Dead Connection would never be the norm until they were developed specifically for powerful consoles and home computers.&nbsp;There is a fairly minor tradeoff for all of that interactivity. Every level in Dead Connection takes place on only one screen. I said it was a tradeoff, but it may be a strength. Keeping the action on one screen means the player has some time with each level. They have time to investigate each of the interactive elements. They can try to use the level in different ways. If the levels were long, scrolling affairs, it would be likely that you would miss a stairway or switch in all the gunfire, and just walk right on by.Dead Connection is an anomaly. A unicorn. The action arcade game that tried to do a lot with a little and succeeded.At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s still an arcade game. Relatively short, borderline impossible without spending a mountain in quarters. But that shouldn&rsquo;t be too surprising. What is surprising is that this game wasn&rsquo;t copied a million times. There are no home console ports. There isn&rsquo;t a genre based around the Dead Connection framework. It is really one of a kind.When you look into the resume of the team who worked on Dead Connection, it all starts to come into focus. They worked on several games that I have either covered in a Best Games or have on my list. Dead Connection was made by people who know how to push the envelope. Try new innovative game design solutions. They made sure that Dead Connection is one of the Best Games.&nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI have been sort of off and on with the game project recently. Between finishing up some polish work on Neon Noodles and getting a couple more stories ready to submit, I haven&rsquo;t done much work on the coding and mechanics side of my 2D game.That isn&rsquo;t to say that nothing has moved forward. It most certainly has, but that movement is mostly in the process and visuals department.I slightly revised my rendering process so that it is both faster and more customizable. I developed the technique of rendering crisp, low resolution, sprites based on 3D models in blender. It works well, but I built it to work on one particular set of animations at a particular scale. Part of my revising has been to make it a more general process. Something that can work for a bunch of different sprites at different scales.&nbsp;As far as the style goes, the sprites don&rsquo;t exactly look like 3D models rendered in Blender. They don&rsquo;t look quite hand drawn, either. So some more work had to be done.The process works, but to get the visuals where I want them, I&rsquo;m going to have to work on my animation. For me, this is great news.I&rsquo;m an animator that rarely gets to do much animation. I spent a bunch of time training my eyes, brain, and hands to detect and recreate motion with life and feeling. I have done a lot of design, modelling, and illustration work over the last few decades, but only a tiny amount of animation. And even less character animation. Now, finding that animation is probably what I need to punch up my visuals is both exciting and terrifying.What if I don&rsquo;t remember how. What if I can&rsquo;t animate something that matches my ambition. I guess I&rsquo;m gonna find out.&#8203;\t\t"

They want everyone to know what they have done. They are seeking infamy. They are seeking immortality.The game itself is a fairly standard space shooter. The absolute earliest video games were stocked to the rafters with space shooters. They had the sci-fi obsessions of the day to thank for that. Star Trek and Star Wars stand as the inspiration for far too many video games. Early and recent. But, unlike their inspirations, very few of those games can claim to be space operas.Silpheed wants to be a space opera.Of course, the very limited scale provided by the japanese PC-88 computer would never allow for a soaring adventure. Not really. So the developers picked their battles. They would wrap a twenty level space shooter in the trappings of anime space operas. They would do anything to make the game feel grander. More important. It worked.After the Shakespeare quote fades, you are immediately treated to a flythrough of a wireframe 3D spacecraft. So again, this game is punching well above its weight. The PC-88 has more in common with a ZX Spectrum than any modern computer. This is not the sort of machine that should be able to do 3D anything. Yet here we are. The effect still resonates today. This is a space shooter game with cinematic trappings. Operatic ambitions.The FM synthesized music is on point throughout. While it&rsquo;s not quite a John Williams score, the sense of grandeur is there.While you start out in Silpheed destroying simple waves of enemy ships, the game quickly escalates to battles over planets, Star Wars style trench runs through massive space stations, and battles against devious boss craft. All of these are intermixed with cinematic interstitials. Silpheed wants so badly to be a grand anime, and for the most part, it hits.When ( if ) you finally reach the climactic battle against the massive battleship, Gloire, you will have to contend with terrifying laser blasts, impenetrable shield walls, and every variety of bullets you have dealt with so far. It&rsquo;s a fitting end to a spectacular game.Silpheed is the sort of game that doesn&rsquo;t seem to fit in the era when it was made. A game too ambitious for the hardware. Too far ahead of its contemporaries. It's the sort of game that spawns a series, which it did, for better and worse. Most of the games that came after were space shooters, but they lacked the space opera wrapping that made the original so memorable.Silpheed is one of the best games.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI&rsquo;m in the cooldown period.Whenever I finish a draft of a story (this is the second of this particular story) I set it aside for a little while before looking it over again. The cooldown period could last anywhere from a few days to a week or so. Just enough time for me to not feel so close to it, but short enough that I haven&rsquo;t forgotten how I want it to feel.It&rsquo;s a luxury, I know. This idea of a cooldown period. Some people are writing at a breakneck pace, or writing to hit deadlines. I can afford a cooldown, and I hope that most other writers are able to find a way to fit such a thing into their schedule.That doesn&rsquo;t mean that I won&rsquo;t be writing for a week. I will just move on to one of the other stories that I&rsquo;ve been working on. I&rsquo;ll just push that one to one side for a short while before I look it over again.The hope is that when I read it over I don&rsquo;t find too many glaring errors or deficiencies. There will likely be a few lines that get tweaked. Maybe some slight rewording here and there. After that, I will send it out into the world where it can gather a few rejections. Currently, I think it&rsquo;s a fairly good story. Something with some sci-fi ideas, but a core of humanity. A story that will speak to at least some audiences out there. A story that says something to me, at the very least. It&rsquo;s something I hope to ultimately sell to one of the major sci-fi outlets. We&rsquo;ll see what I think of it in a week.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tA while ago, I created a method of rendering out fixed direction Normal and Depth information from 3D models in milliseconds, rather than the seconds or tens of seconds that it would take using most common methods. That might not seem like a lot, but if you start rendering out animations, those seconds stack up.I thought that I would mostly use this technique to make brushes and details for texturing 3D models. Sort of like 3D stickers. I&rsquo;ve found a new use for it.If you look up baking out maps using Blender or really any 3D software, there will likely be a convoluted method that you have to follow, because hey, that&rsquo;s just how doing anything in 3D goes. It&rsquo;s a set of difficult to memorize steps and processes and when anyone new to 3D asks why, 90% of the time the answer will just be &lsquo;because&rsquo;. Odds are, the person you ask will either not know why, or they will and the answer will be too tedious and convoluted to get into. It will probably involve some decision about rendering made in 1994. So, rather than asking why, you follow those steps and you get a result, but if your particular use case or problem is even slightly different than the tutorial, well good luck to you. You have strayed well into the realm of the technical artist.The thing is, most applications don&rsquo;t need the long route. The standard route. Sometimes you can &lsquo;cheat&rsquo;. Sometimes cheating is the best option. Cheating is what technical artists do.I have been working on an old school arcade game project. Something that looks and, more importantly, feels like it came from a late 80s or early 90s arcade. But, just because I want it to feel that way, doesn&rsquo;t mean that it has to be made that way, or even be possible on old hardware.I started out by creating some hand animation, to test if what I wanted would be possible. It seemed like it was. Then I moved on to 3D art and animation. My experience very definitely lies in 3D animation, but I had to make sure that I could replicate a look similar to the 2D animation. After some work and some very distorted proportions, it worked. I made a set of 3D animations, that when rendered out, resembled my 2D tests.Now that the art and animation was in the 3D space, I could get weird. I had already created the Normal and Depth techniques, so what would happen if I tossed those at the problem? Turns out, it works pretty well.Rendering out an entire set of test animations from all the required angles takes a few seconds. Rendering out the extra Normal and Depth passes only adds another second or two. So, while the setup and animation times might be longer than a strictly 2D approach to art creation, for this project iteration takes almost no time at all. I can change an animation, change a model, change colours, and on and on with very little extra effort. I can change lighting on the resulting 2D sprites in realtime, thanks to the Normal and Depth maps. The result is probably not something that arcade hardware could do in 1990, but that&rsquo;s not important. What&rsquo;s important is that it feels like it could really be from that time. I&rsquo;m probably going to waste more memory space than any of those old machines had just on a single character sprite.This project is only just getting started, and I&rsquo;m not exactly sure where it will end up, but small successes like this are what move the whole thing forward. Now I know that the process works. The type of graphics I want are possible, and more importantly, possible by me as a solo developer. Maybe I will get to the place where I want to pay someone else to work on this with me, but right now I have to do what I can to make it real on my own.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tAs I type this, my son is downstairs playing Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom. When he&rsquo;s not playing it, he&rsquo;s watching videos about it. The rest of the time, I&rsquo;m probably playing it.It&rsquo;s a very good game.The controls are great, but not entirely friction free. The puzzles are great, but not entirely satisfying. The construction is great, but occasionally tedious. It&rsquo;s pretty close to a perfect game. I think it might be that &ldquo;pretty close&rdquo; that makes me want to play more of it.When Breath of the Wild came out, a lot of people got very angry about weapon and shield degradation. It&rsquo;s true that having a bow or sword shatter mid-fight is annoying, but it very quickly reached the same level of annoyance as having to reload in a shooter. It only slightly breaks your flow and, if you are ready for it, you can easily switch weapons to keep swinging. So what that teaches you, is to be ready for it.&nbsp;In the previous game, weapons shattering meant that you would have to sample all the weapons the game had on offer. At some point you would be up against a tough enemy and you would have to pull out that club or spear that you would never otherwise use. I thought it added some fun to the game, but some people, by virtue of being forced into it, were not as interested.In Tears of the Kingdom you can essentially create new types of weapons at any time by fusing items together. This flips the weapon breakage mechanic on its head. Instead of requiring that you use different weapons, you will want to try all of them. What happens if you fuse a stick to a rock, a sword to a glowing flower, an arrow to some monster parts? Who can say? It doesn&rsquo;t take long before you are just hitting things with a badly fused weapon to break it intentionally so that you can try one of your new ones. Testing new weapons has become part of the game that you will want to engage with.Other than that one small change, the weapon degradation system is mostly intact. One simple change. Fusing weapons to create new items turns a mechanic that could be tedious into an opportunity to play.There is a school of game design wisdom that says you should always be building toward whatever is the most fun. When people bristled against the previous design, rather than tossing it out, Nintendo built toward something more fun. I think it worked.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Area 51Arcade light gun games are a tough one. I can write about them here, but unless you happen to have an arcade or a barcade near you, I don&rsquo;t know that there is an easy way to play them. You could always play them using a mouse on an emulator, but I can&rsquo;t recommend that. It feels pretty bad.Years ago I bought a light gun that works with non-crt displays, but due to time and old drivers getting it to run on current hardware is challenging. It sits in a box inside my arcade cabinet. It will likely continue to. As a result I haven&rsquo;t played many light gun games unless I happen to be at an arcade. That&rsquo;s unfortunate because I truly love some of them. Area 51 is near the top of that list.Area 51 didn&rsquo;t break any new ground for the genre. There were already more technically advanced light gun games available when it came out. It did some new things, combining pre-rendered and live action footage was fairly novel. It used some interesting hardware that was across between a home console and a pc. None of that makes Area 51 good. Area 51 is good, because it excels at hitting that ball straight down the middle.Arcade games are experiences. Some can offer a challenge or provide a way for people to compete head-to-head. Games can create a sort of fantasy or sense of escapism. At their heart, they are experiences, just like amusement park rides. Some of the best amusement park rides give you exactly what you are expecting. No hidden twists, no surprise endings. It&rsquo;s just exactly what you are looking for.That might seem like another way of saying &lsquo;mediocre&rsquo; or &lsquo;dull&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s anything but. It takes real skill to create exactly the sort of experience a player is looking for, and keep that experience going for as long as they are playing. Not only that, but they have to want to come back to play again and again. Area 51 absolutely nails it. It is a consistently solid experience every single time you play.Here&rsquo;s where I get to be very specifically nerdy. I used to play Area 51 using both guns. Every Area 51 cabinet has two light guns tethered to it so two people can play together. One day, on a whim, I thought &lsquo;why don&rsquo;t I just try both&rsquo;. I wanted to play it that way ever since. John Woo-ing it up at the arcade. I tried the same trick playing Lethal Enforcers and the like, but only Virtua Cop played as well with both guns.I got pretty good at it too. Like actually good. I didn&rsquo;t feel like I played well unless my left hand accuracy was above 80% and my score was similar on both hands. I&rsquo;m not left handed. I probably didn&rsquo;t set any records, but I was good at it.It was easy to get good, because the game is easy to love. It&rsquo;s simple, straight forward, and it does exactly what you want it to do, and it does it very well.Area 51 might be a simple game, but it&rsquo;s one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

I don&rsquo;t know.A while ago I set a goal of creating one new first draft of a short story every month. Keeping that schedule has been pretty easy. What hasn&rsquo;t been as easy, is finishing a final draft that I can send out, that hasn&rsquo;t gone as well.I have two stories out for consideration as I write this (might be three when you read it) but they have been out for quite a while. One of them has really done the rounds. It&rsquo;s been held for repeat reads and comments multiple times but ultimately, in every case so far, it hasn&rsquo;t been accepted.They places they are waiting at right now have had them for quite a while. Like several months. That&rsquo;s sort of the way it goes sometimes, but still, it&rsquo;s been long enough that I occasionally forget what story has gone where.Still no word on when my second published story will see print, but that too will just have to wait.In the meantime, I keep working on these stories that I wrote first drafts of. I have four of them up on blocks, and I dig around under their hoods every few days. One is pretty close to ready. Another needs a bit more work, but it&rsquo;s not terribly far off. The other two are in states of disarray. I have half a dozen more that I haven&rsquo;t even taken a second look at, but they will all need work.At some point I will probably have several stories submitted to outlets at once, but not yet.It would be easy to see not having a bunch of stories ready as some sort of failure, but I keep working on them so that&rsquo;s better than abandoning them.I know that I&rsquo;m not a particularly fast or prolific writer, I just hope that when I get a story out there for people to read that they enjoy it. I&rsquo;ll take making enjoyable stories over making a lot of stories anytime.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThis week, I did my first bit of 2D, by hand, frame to frame, animation in more than twenty years. To be clear, this wasn&rsquo;t on paper, it&rsquo;s likely been even longer since I&rsquo;ve done that, but it was the same sort of -flip back and forth making small changes by hand- style of animation that I haven&rsquo;t done since school.If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with different styles of animation, traditional animation is a very different process than 3D animation, or even present day, computer assisted 2D animation. What I was doing was the computer assisted 2D style, but even that is very different from what I usually do.Just to get ahead of it here, if you are reading this and you aren&rsquo;t familiar with different styles of animation, no, 3D animation is not easier. Computer assisted 2D animation is not easier. They are different in the details and tools, but extremely similar in the fundamentals. There are certain ways that 3D animation is more conveniently fit into a tight schedule and pipeline that make it attractive for movie and TV production, but that has more to do with division of labour than actually doing any animation. For games, the reason to do 3D over 2D is more technical, and related to how the hardware works. There is no secret tool or style that makes animation &lsquo;easy&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s slow and methodical work, no matter how you do it.The style of animation that I am trained to do, and have done off an on for most of my life at this point, is 3D. That involves building digital puppets, &lsquo;rigging&rsquo; them with digital bones and controls, and then recording the movement of those bones through space and time. It&rsquo;s a style of animation where most of the work is loaded on the front end of the process. When all the set-up and animation is done, the end of the job might be as simple as pressing the &lsquo;render&rsquo; button. It&rsquo;s a style of working that is very technical and heavy on planning and you have to work very hard to make it feel intuitive or improvisational.2D animation, on the other hand, is very quick to get started. Simply draw a line, flip to a new sheet of paper or create a new frame in your computer assisted animation program, and draw another line in a slightly different position. Flip back and forth between the two frames and you have created motion. Keep adding lines and frames and you can make a character move, dance, fight, laugh, breath, live. Starting is easy, but there is no &lsquo;Render&rsquo; button. You never need to read documentation to figure out how to &lsquo;rig&rsquo; a bit of traditional animation, but you will need to learn and internalize anatomy and kinematics.I disagree with a lot of teaching that would have you learn traditional animation before 3D, as if one is an extension of the other. They are very different, but at their core they share the disciplines of observation, movement, timing, and acting. Learning one will inform the other.&nbsp;Soccer is not built on the foundations of track and field. They are different sports with different skills required, but they do share enough basics that a person skilled at one may be able to learn the other.&nbsp;So, in an afternoon this week, I managed to create a simple hand drawn, 2D animation. Admittedly, it isn&rsquo;t very good animation, but it worked for my tests.There will be a combination of 3D and 2D animation in my Godot project, but all of that is filtered through a very 2D presentation. I needed to know that I could combine the two while still having it look cohesive. So far, it&rsquo;s working quite well. I sort of hope that I can fool at least a couple of people into believing that this project could have been made on an arcade machine in the early 90s. Technically, it works. I&rsquo;ll have to work on making my animation slightly better than test quality to really sell it. I don&rsquo;t mind being the weakest link in that chain.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games -&nbsp; Duke Nukem 3DI&rsquo;ll start this off by addressing the realities of time. Just trust that I will get around to why Duke Nukem 3D deserves to be on the list of best games, but we have a necessary detour to travel first.The Character and tone of Duke Nukem has not aged well. Or maybe it would be more accurate to say that the framing of the character hasn&rsquo;t aged well. If you go back and play Duke Nukem 3D, it seems fairly obvious that the creators of the game made Duke the butt of a lot of his own jokes. Most of his one-liners are simply lifted from films and TV shows, and often in a way that seems to suggest that Duke himself is unaware of context or nuance. This isn&rsquo;t an example of a character saying or doing things that were once okay and now aren&rsquo;t. Duke isn&rsquo;t cool, he&rsquo;s a misogynistic, meathead, dumbass, and he sucked back then too. The problem is, this doesn&rsquo;t always come across, and there are far too many people that assumed if Duke was the main character of the game, then he must also be the &lsquo;Hero&rsquo; of the game. Duke is the protagonist, but he is not heroic.This is an absolutely valid way to write a protagonist. There is no rule that says protagonists need to be likeable, or right, or decent people. They only have to be the point of view character for your story. Or, in this instance, game.There is a possible timeline where Duke Nukem Forever doesn&rsquo;t come out. Where Duke Nukem 3D is the one game that exists where Duke has been gifted any sort of personality at all. He is seen for what he is, terrible, but comedic and farcical. And the game shines because of that knowing farce, and not in spite of it.Unfortunately, we live in this reality, this timeline. People have wilfully misinterpreted a buffoon as heroic, and we have to address that.There, now that that&rsquo;s out of the way, we can get to it.Duke Nukem 3D is a masterpiece of design.In a time when first person shooter game design meant navigating what are essentially mazes and occasionally shooting at monsters, Duke Nukem 3D aimed to create spaces. When you play Duke 3D, you will run around a lot and you will shoot a lot of alien monsters, but the spaces that you are playing in feel a lot more real and a lot less mazelike. They are recreations of spaces you might recognize. Streets, a theatre, stores, offices, apartments, and even when the game swerves into more alien architecture, the sense that these are usable spaces is still there. Despite the slightly janky pseudo 3D graphics of the build engine, navigation in Duke 3D feels, for lack of a more accurate term, real.Duke 3D is also one of the first games to create a sense of place by having a lot of intractable elements. Light switches turn on and off lights. Security cameras show different parts of the level. Urinals, toilets, and mirrors work. They do the things you expect they will do. The game is a long way from a systems based simulation, but just having a few things function as you would expect means that the spaces those interactables inhabit feel more real as well. It&rsquo;s a necessary step forward.Other complex simulation games existed, System Shock, for example, but they tended to be fiddly and complicated in a way that didn&rsquo;t really provide that sense of place. Place has to feel easy. It has to feel natural. It has to feel intuitive. Duke Nukem 3D does that. That ease makes the gameplay feel real. It&rsquo;s truly a wonderful thing, and makes for one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI&rsquo;ve been working on a bunch of shaders recently. Some of them do things to the pixels as they are drawn to the screen and some of them do stuff to the geometry before the pixels get drawn to the screen. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter, the result is the same. There is some input information, a program beats that up a little, and then it draws the result.I&rsquo;ve said before, here and elsewhere, that I&rsquo;m a pretty mediocre programmer. I&rsquo;m very good at organizing procedures. Planning out all the steps it will take to go from, say, input pixels to output results. The job of creating digital art, be it 3D, 2D, animated, or some mix of all of them, is 99% that. Creating a pipeline from input to result. It&rsquo;s a lot less &ldquo;feel&rdquo; or &ldquo;intuition&rdquo; based than most people would think. There are practiced steps that get the work from start to whatever anyone wants to call finished.So maybe what I mean when I say &lsquo;mediocre programmer&rsquo; is that I program like an artist.I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m saying.I&rsquo;m going to go back to these shaders. I almost have one of them modifying some pixels in just the way I want.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tMy 2D game project is coming along. Most of my time with it has just been learning the ins and outs of Godot 4.Like I said before, I have only really done a very small amount of dabbling with Godot, and that was quite a while ago. It seems like a very competent engine, and everything that I have wanted to do with it, I have been able to get working. After a while.The biggest issue I&rsquo;m having is that most of the tutorials and learning material are made in their built-in language, GDScript. GDScript is a python-like programming language that is, by all reports, made to be very easy to use.I hate it.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m sure I could learn to use it. I&rsquo;m sure I would even like using it after a while, but when I want to just make a thing that is in my head, I can&rsquo;t stand programming in it.Luckily, the developers of Godot have added C# support. Coming from years of messing with Unity, I am so much more comfortable with C#. That means that the code I write is at least readable by me, and the things I try I can usually get to work.The downside of using C#, is again, all the learning material is written in GDScript. I&rsquo;m finding that I spend a lot of my &lsquo;development&rsquo; time translating from GDScript examples to C#. I could just follow the examples, but then when I go to change something or extend the example script, something I will always have to do, I have trouble figuring it out. It&rsquo;s a language barrier issue. So, I&rsquo;m finding it&rsquo;s actually easier to translate to C# and go from there.&nbsp;On one hand, that does make my work a lot slower. On the other hand, future me will understand what I did and will be able to make changes. I&rsquo;m doing future me a favour here. I hope he&rsquo;s thankful for it.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Half-LifeHalf-Life isn&rsquo;t a game. It&rsquo;s a place. It&rsquo;s somewhere you go for a while. You spend time there. Like going on vacation or travelling to an amusement park.You will have fun. You will have new and uncommon experiences. A lot of those experiences will be designed for you. You wouldn&rsquo;t call an amusement park a game. You wouldn&rsquo;t call a holiday a game. They&rsquo;re different.Half-Life is like that.There were, of course, many first person games, adventure games, and even first person adventure games, before Half-Life. Half-Life was built on a modified Quake engine, so there was already a legacy of first person games when Valve started working on it.It&rsquo;s not surprising that Half-Life shares a lot with those earlier games. Fast action, lots of shooting, encounter spaces custom built to deliver certain moments. The difference is, most previous games are sort of a set of toys, or a series of challenges. Half-Life is a place that you inhabit for a while.The story for the original Half-Life is not earth shaking. You won&rsquo;t feel emotionally invested in the characters or plot, but it&rsquo;s serviceable. There is enough there to give purpose to your actions.What you will feel, is a sense of place. You will recognize the shape of the world of the game. It will be encoded in you as if it were real. That makes everything you do there much more meaningful.In the very opening moments of Half-Life, you are introduced peacefully to the environments you will later be fighting through. The opening of the game is slow and methodical and mundane. You have time to wander. You become accustomed to the lighting, the sounds. How common and normal everything is. You are given just enough time before everything changes.I think that the first person perspective does a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to really burning the locations and events of Half-Life into your brain. Doom was probably the first game that gave me that feeling of truly playing in a new environment. I remember those places, but there was no logic or reason to Doom or Quake levels. They are built for your enjoyment, not for practical reasons. The areas from Half-Life are pulling double duty. They act as interesting gameplay spaces, but they also have a sense of practical realism to them. This is a place where people worked and lived. They did paperwork here. They chatted with friends here. They picked fantasy football teams and brought their kids to work. This is a recognizable and real place. Until it isn&rsquo;t. And that makes the events of the entire Half-Life series so much more memorable and terrifying.Maybe Half-Life isn&rsquo;t the absolute first game to create this sense of place, but nothing before (and even for a while after) took advantage of that feeling in quite the same way.Half-Life is one of the most enjoyable adventure travel destinations, and maybe even best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI like to ride my bike. If I&rsquo;m going somewhere fairly nearby, I will probably take my bike. If I&rsquo;m going somewhere further, but plan to stay a while, I will probably take my bike. If I&rsquo;m going to be drinking, I will absolutely take my bike.For quite a while, if I was headed downtown, I would bike to the train and ride it the rest of the way. More and more often, I have been riding the entire 10 to 20km for events. If the weather is nice and the paths are mostly clear, it&rsquo;s great. If there is snow on the path, but it&rsquo;s packed down, I just take the fat tire bike, and it&rsquo;s great. If it&rsquo;s really cold, I dress warmer.I&rsquo;m sure this sounds bonkers to a lot of people, but think of it this way. I never need to look for or pay for parking. I can always choose to have another beer before I leave a place (I never do, but I could). My bike never runs out of fuel and I never have to fill it up. My largest ongoing expense is extra train tickets when I don&rsquo;t want to ride.Then there is the maintenance. Most bike parts last for years or even decades. My main bike frame is about 20 years old. I have replaced a lot of the main components in that time, but not all of them. The real kicker is that when those parts did need replacing, I did it myself. If you look around a bit you can get most of the parts cheaper than at a bike shop too. I think there are two special purpose tools that you need to fix a bicycle. A chain tool, and a crank puller. A bike stand is nice, but not required. Other than that, it&rsquo;s all wrenches and screwdrivers.I know to some people I&rsquo;m &lsquo;that guy who rides his bike everywhere&rsquo; but it&rsquo;s just so much easier than driving sometimes. More relaxed. Safer. Even in the cold. You put on a snow helmet, goggles, and mask, and you can ride through a lot of weather.Except rain. I hate riding in the rain.That&rsquo;s all. I did some seasonal tune-ups on my bike and it made me think about how much I like biking. Nothing more to it. Go ride a bike. They&rsquo;re good.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI&rsquo;m working on a small test project with Godot. The last, and only, time that I did anything significant with Godot was a game jam back in 2019. Safe to say that it&rsquo;s been a while. Also, safe to say that Godot has changed a lot in that time.I&rsquo;m only at the very beginnings of figuring out how the engine works, and I&rsquo;m pretty certain I didn&rsquo;t understand it back when I made a whole game jam project with it. On one hand, I miss some of the nifty tools and add-ons for Unity. On the other hand, I really like how uncluttered and simple it is. Where Unity has some pretty prescribed ways of working, Godot is a bit more &ldquo;*shrug* how do you want to do it&rdquo;. There are a lot of ways to achieve the same goal, but a handful of them are sort of built for you. Maybe. To translate it into terms that only my old 3d modeller brain will understand, it&rsquo;s more like Maya 1.0 and less like whatever Maya is now. All the parts are there, but some assembly might be required.If you haven&rsquo;t been reading any of these, or you don&rsquo;t know me very well, you might not know that &lsquo;some assembly required&rsquo; is pretty much my happy place. I like to put stuff together, and I like to figure out new ways of making things, but I&rsquo;m not about to try to program my own engine or anything.I will be posting sporadic updates on the progress of this thing. If you recall, a few weeks ago, I posted an image of a CRT filter painting setup.

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Driver : You are the WheelmanDriver is filthy. It looks filthy. It sounds filthy. The slap base, funk soundtrack is filthy. The 70s exploitation storyline is filthy.The driving is absolutely spotless.That&rsquo;s a very good thing, because the only thing you do in Driver, is drive.There are a lot of driving games, but they tend to be racing centric. You might race around virtual versions of real tracks with virtual versions of real cars, or you might race on fictional tracks with fictional cars. No matter the combination of those, you will be &lsquo;simulating&rsquo; a sport. Getting from one place to another, in competition with other drivers. That means you are primarily using the car to travel forward as fast as possible. There are other ways to use a car.Driver is a semi-open world game based on real locations, where you may as well be playing as the car. There is a story, involving you taking on the role of an undercover cop, but there are no real opportunities for you to interact with the world outside of a car.The game is called Driver, and you drive.What driver did, that only Grand Theft Auto 3 would do a few months later, was to treat a car as a way of navigating a space. Going flat out at all times isn&rsquo;t the way to beat the game. Turning, sliding, going in reverse, and even driving casually at the speed limit are all tools you will need to master in Driver. Since you are, allegedly, an undercover cop and not an autonomous vehicle, keeping a low profile is pretty important. Why draw the wrath of random patrol cars when you don&rsquo;t need to.None of that would work if the driving didn&rsquo;t feel right. There is a weight and momentum to the vehicles in Driver that is extremely satisfying. You spend most of your time in American muscle cars and huge boxy sedans with chromed steel bumpers. These aren&rsquo;t twitchy sports cars that stick to a track. They want to keep moving in whatever direction you propel them. Sometimes that means driving up a curb or through a park or crashing through other cars.There are other modes that task you with either chasing or evading other cars, and despite the developers putting time into the mission based story mode, these are where you will have the most fun playing Driver. This is what the game is really about. Using a car to navigate a space in any way that a Playstation game from 1999 could muster.There is something to be said for exploring a mechanic fully. Using all of the available verbs. There are more verbs when driving a car than just racing, and all of them can be fun. Games that set up playgrounds for that sort of mechanical exploration aren&rsquo;t super common, so when they come along, we should celebrate them.Driver is about driving, and it&rsquo;s one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI&rsquo;m currently getting a story ready for submission. I haven&rsquo;t sold any stories recently, but I have gotten a couple of holds and a couple more personal rejections. I&rsquo;m not completely numb to rejection yet, but I have to tell you, anything you do a lot of, you get better at. I have a large collection of rejection letters, so I suppose I&rsquo;m getting better at that.I wrote a bit about editing not that long ago, so I&rsquo;m not going to get too deep into it here, but I do have something else that I would like to touch on.My own personal inclination is working on multiple projects at once. I know that is anathema to some people, but I constantly find it to be a reinforcing practice. Working on one thing will improve another thing I am thinking about, or working on. Editing this particular story helped me find solutions to problems I was having with two other stories. These are solutions that I might have come to if I had only worked on one story at a time, but I doubt it.I have also talked about how brains like to work on background processes. At least that seems to be how my brain works. Setting a story as a background process means that I will probably figure out some way to improve it while I work on something else. Sometimes that other thing I&rsquo;m working on is a piece of art, or code, or construction, or metal work, or even another story. Stories seem to be particularly good at running as a background process. Again, this is in my brain. Maybe your brain might be better at running different things as background processes.Mine likes stories.There is, of course, an upside and a downside to working this way. On the upside, nothing is ever abandoned, because you can have a lot of background processes running. On the downside, you have to be extremely disciplined about keeping notes, and knowing the difference between being distracted away from whatever your main task is, and taking a moment to make a note.I still have to work at both of those, but just like rejection, everything you do a lot of, you get better at. I have made it a habit to quickly mark up stories so that I can remember how to fix them when I eventually get around to it. I usually write in Scrivener, but I keep google doc versions of most of my writing, so that I can make those notes no matter where I am, but in both, I use the same system for adding notes to already written passages. I use a hierarchy of folders and files, and all of that is automatically backed up so that I don&rsquo;t accidentally lose any stories or notes and I know where to look when I get back to working on a particular story.It is likely that very little of this is helpful to anyone else writing, or trying to write, but you can take this as permission to work on more than one thing. Absolutely, make a habit of finishing stories, but bouncing from one to the other and pushing them all forward is absolutely a valid way to work. In some cases, it will even be helpful. Let those background processes run.&#8203;\t\t"

I can&rsquo;t use it with Blender or Krita or the desktop version of Affinity Designer, at least not easily, and all three of those are go to apps for me, but I do use the iPad to draw and paint pretty regularly. So, eight. The number of graphics tablets I have used is eight. That seems like a lot.I am thinking about this now, because several times a year, every year, I consider getting a new graphics tablet. This is just part of the natural cycle of things.The one I currently use is a Huion HS610. It&rsquo;s perfectly capable and I like it quite a bit. Other than occasionally brushing the scroll wheel with my hand, I don&rsquo;t think I have any issues with it. The only reason I have for thinking about a new tablet, is that I saw there were some screen based pen displays on sale. I don&rsquo;t really need one, but that never stopped anyone from wanting a thing.Very recently, I saw a pixel artist (who apparently used a mouse?) asking the game dev community whether a graphics tablet is worth it. As someone who has owned six of the things (I think we decided on six) I had to say, emphatically, yes.Not only are graphics tablets amazing tools for artists at any stage of their career or development, having one has almost certainly saved me from worse RSI than I currently have. I switch constantly, from tablet, to trackball, to mouse. The changing hand positions and movement ranges keep my carpal tunnels from getting too distressed.The other reason I can recommend a graphics tablet is pretty simple. They are so much cheaper now than they have ever been. A new Huion tablet can be picked up for the same price as a mid range mouse. My second Wacom Intuos cost something like $200 and it was far less capable than anything you can buy today.Even if you only think you will use it occasionally, I think a graphics tablet is a purchase you likely won&rsquo;t regret.I think that&rsquo;s all I have to say this week. I just think graphics tablets are nifty keen and worth getting. I think I&rsquo;ll go back to drooling over some glossy, 4k, pen displays, and convincing myself that I don&rsquo;t really need one.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThere is a particular look that some old games have that I love. I&rsquo;ve been chasing it for ages, and I think I&rsquo;ve finally figured out how to achieve it.         I&rsquo;m the sort of guy who still plays some game from the early 90s almost daily. Usually it&rsquo;s some flavour of street fighter. I know the nostalgia for those games is deep in my bones. Nostalgia can be a positive force, or a negative one. People suffering from nostalgia can sometimes convince themselves that the past was better. That the way things worked were better. What they remember was better than what currently is. This is almost universally wrong.I still love those old games. They are still enjoyable, even without the nostalgia. They are not better. In so many ways, they are far worse than what we have now. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that there aren&rsquo;t aspects of those games to love.I got rid of the last CRT in this house a few years ago, and I have no intention of obtaining another one. It&rsquo;s worse than what we have now in so many ways that it&rsquo;s difficult to compare. The LCD, and OLED screens that we have now, are better. Period. By any reasonable metric, just better. But they are different.So, here&rsquo;s my issue, I love old games, and I love the look of some old games, but I think breaking out the old hardware just to see them is ludicrous. If I can&rsquo;t be bothered to break out a CRT to play these games, you can be damn sure that I won&rsquo;t be using ancient tools to create these sorts of graphics.CRTs work very differently to modern displays, and the artifacts of how they function are part of how those old games looked. There is some tendency among game nostalgia sufferers to believe that artist of that time were wizards or more capable than modern artists. Of course, that&rsquo;s nonsense. They were doing the best they could with what they had. What they had were displays that glow and fluoresce in uneven, but controllable, ways. None of the pixel art in CRT based games was ever intended to be seen unfiltered by an aperture grill. Unblurred by light bleed. It is an art form tied to a specific technology with specific limitations and specific qualities. Qualities that you can fake well enough, if you mess around with digital art tools long enough.I know there are a lot of CRT filter shaders out there. Some of them are very good and very convincing. What I couldn&rsquo;t find were any art creation tools that would help an artist to create graphics that would look correct when run through one of these filters. So I made one.Currently this is a series of Krita layers that mimic a set of optical effects. They are mostly just Multiply and Addition filters, literally taking the base pixel values and multiplying or adding them by another value. Basic stuff that computers are great at. I also have a set of blurs that are slightly more difficult, but also something that modern computers can crunch through very quickly.My set of layers let me paint with any tool in Krita&rsquo;s box of brushes. It all updates in real-time to look like a limited set of colors are being represented as large chunky pixels and filtered through a CRT screen. It&rsquo;s all instantaneous. No waiting for something to render. No testing my pixel art through a secondary CRT filter. No creating using a limited set of pixel art tools. Just paint, and see it as if it were the early 90s.I don&rsquo;t know about you, but that seems to satisfy my nostalgia.&#8203;       \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Final FightThere were side scrolling beat &lsquo;em up games before Final Fight. Capcom didn&rsquo;t invent the genre. That honor should probably go to Technos and the Kunio-kun series. The Technos game Double Dragon may have even been the first game to truly nail walking right and punching. Those games are great too, and I will probably get to them at some point, but this write up is about Final Fight.First, let's talk about the characters. The bigness of the characters. Can you imagine, walking into an arcade in 1990 and seeing a lot of games with little characters or planes or spaceships, and then you look over and there are these positively giant men of this one screen just punching the crap out of each other? It&rsquo;s not only a couple of dudes, either. The screen is full of huge men and women. All of them are punching and kicking and flipping.There have been some big guys on screens before Final Fight. Some of the guys on Double Dragon are pretty big. Nothing like this though. The guys on screen in Final Fight are enormous. They are detailed and vibrant in a way that&rsquo;s still pretty shocking to look at today.&#8203;   \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t          \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t          \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t \t   Just look at that. Also, that door has DICK written on it.Big, glorious sprites are great and all, but if the game doesn&rsquo;t play well, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter how pretty it is.This is a developer that is one iteration away from creating Street Fighter II, inarguably one of the best fighting games ever made. While games like Streets of Rage, and subsequent brawler games, might feel as good or even better than Final Fight, at the time when it was released, Final Fight had the fastest, most precise, most solid feeling hand to hand combat that had ever graced an arcade machine. Characters punch and kick almost as fast as you can press the buttons. There are a small set of special moves for each character, and some unique joystick and button inputs. A combination of speed, animation, and sound effects make punches and kicks feel like they land. Sprites don&rsquo;t just overlap or pass through each other, they hit. It&rsquo;s all an illusion, but it&rsquo;s a satisfying one.Other developers would go on to make better, faster, more complicated brawlers in the years after Final Fight, but this is the game that gave those other teams permission. This is the one that paved the way.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s so beloved that most, if not all, characters from Final Fight have made appearances in other Capcom games, several of them showing up as playable characters in the Street Fighter series.Final Fight is one of the best games, and that door just has DICK written on it.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWhile I can&rsquo;t post the stories that came out of the writing jam thing I did for the last six weeks, I can put up my postmortem wrap up on how the whole thing went for me. I&rsquo;ve done a few edits to remove spoilers and such.Without the stories to go with them, this set of write-ups might not have a lot of context, but I think there is enough of the process of going from idea to story, that it might be interesting for some people.&nbsp;--I&rsquo;ve only recently joined Codex. I don&rsquo;t really know anyone here, and no one knows me, so I&rsquo;ve been fairly quiet. When I saw that this contest/story jam was happening, I jumped at it. I&rsquo;m glad I did. I&rsquo;ve had fun coming up with new stories every week. I normally work much slower. I think at least 3 out of the 6 can be made into something good. I waffle between which 3 that might be on an hourly basis.I&rsquo;m still fairly quiet, and I&rsquo;ll probably stay that way for a while, but interacting with a few of you during this was nice.I&rsquo;ve never done anything like this for writing before, and I&rsquo;ve never attempted Flash length, but I have participated in a lot of game jams. For better or worse, I approached WW in much the same way. Arrive each week as blank a slate as I can, and say yes to the ideas as they come.I hadn&rsquo;t really considered the scores (and to be completely honest, I don&rsquo;t think I understood the competition format of WW until about week 3), so those didn&rsquo;t really factor into what I chose to write. The comments, on the other hand, were great. Almost all the criticisms of my stories I found myself agreeing with, especially if they were pointing out something I cut or wish I could have added or clarified. Others were pointing out something I hadn&rsquo;t considered or didn&rsquo;t know might be a stumbling block for readers, and those are always immensely helpful.So, thank you. I hope to use all of that and get these stories out into the wild, where all stories belong.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Week 0&nbsp;Title - Know thy Enemy, Know thyselfPrompt - Are you familiar with the works of Sun Tzu?Fun fact about me. Before I switched to art and animation, I studied poli sci. I read, wrote about, and talked about a lot of &lsquo;classics in political thought&rsquo;, Sun Tzu among them.As a result of all that reading, I might have a different take on these writings. I&rsquo;m usually pretty baffled by the typical business bro take on the likes of Machiavelli, Musashi, or Sun Tzu. I think it might be fair to say that many of them have read these books and misinterpreted them badly.&nbsp;One fun direction to take a game jam prompt is to go absolutely, painfully, literal. I figured that might be fun, since the characters in my story were going to be blissfully unaware of nuance or irony.I think the result is something sort of fun and goofy, but not the kind of story I could expand or refine into anything worthwhile. It&rsquo;s sort of a skit.It was a silly thing and a fun warm up, but I can&rsquo;t imagine taking it much further than that.Week 1Title - TortoisesPrompt - Break SomethingThis prompt made me think, what if you fixed something so hard that you broke it? What if that something was a person?This led to wild thoughts of immortality and the mental consequences of dealing with that much time.I considered the counter to that. A group of people that had become, or had been created, immortal. The spawned mind is a person that can&rsquo;t conceive of its own end. Linear time is an inconvenient part of existing, but they don&rsquo;t understand mortality. They are young (perpetually?) and inquisitive.So the story is an eternal child trying to understand an eternally old man trying to understand a very old tortoise. Each of them trying to deal with time in their own way, and none of them ever being able to truly connect.&nbsp;I think I managed to capture a bit of what I was going for in 750 words, but this is a story that needs a little more room. I&rsquo;ll be reworking it and filling out the character of the spawned mind a bit more to establish how completely alien the characters are to one another, while still being recognizable as human.This was probably my most evenly successful story for readers. I think the parts I had to cut (about 500 words) didn&rsquo;t harm the flow of it too badly, but several comments hit on things that I left ambiguous only because the passages that clarified them had been cut.This story has already grown a bit, but it will probably top out around 2000 words or so.&nbsp;Week 2Title - So Much More Than MagicPrompt - &ldquo;all adventures, especially into new territory, are scary.&rdquo; Sally RideI batted around a few of the prompts this week, but Sally Ride&rsquo;s quote stuck with me. Sally Ride was, above all else, a scientist. That made me think, what&rsquo;s a more frightening adventure than changing the way you think. How you ask questions. The transition from knowing that the world works one way and then being shown that there might be a new way to look at it. A way with more questions than established answers. At least it might be frightening at the start.I don&rsquo;t think I succeeded with the way I wrote this story. After I posted it, I thought of so many revisions and refinements. Things to remove, things to add. I think I will be able to pull this one together, but it might take a few passes.&nbsp;This one came in right at the bottom of my group for the week. That was a little disheartening, until I read the comments. The parts that I wanted to hit seemed to be hitting, but the cuts I had to make to stuff it all down to size were just too harsh. Many of the comments cited things that I had cut to an almost eerie degree of specificity. It was probably pretty obvious those parts were missing.I think my main failure here was properly scoping the story and pace to the constraints.Week 3Title - Zero Regrets for the Apocalypse (rummage sale title)Prompt - What&rsquo;s the strangest thing you have ever eaten?I looked at the prompts. Nothing stuck.I spun through the title rummage sale. Nothing kicked off any ideas.As soon as I put the prompts in one window and the titles in another, the two parts of this story snapped together.What if someone ate the moon? And they loved it. They wanted more, even if that means an apocalypse, everyone else be damned. When making the decision between personal desire and potential annihilation, what if a seemingly good person chose desire. It&rsquo;s not that hard to imagine. It happens all the time. We all do it constantly.Maybe this is an allegory, maybe this is just a goofy, absurdist story. Maybe it&rsquo;s both.Most people seemed to be on board with this story. Others, not so much.I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a much larger story, probably still flash, but I think there is an audience for it. I&rsquo;m going to do some more work on it to find out.Week 4Title - Excerpts from the notes of Lance Corporal Thomas Dusanne&nbsp;Prompts - Open a book randomly and find the second paragraph - and - you discover a family secret&nbsp;I had been thinking about writing in an epistolary format, simply because I have never tried that before. Discovering a family secret, or long-lost document, seemed to fit the bill. I was still floundering a bit so I tried the Open a Book prompt and stumbled onto a date in 1915. Add a dash of can-con and some horror elements and I was off and running.&nbsp;I did a lot of research for this one, read and listened to many letters and notebooks of Canadian soldiers from WWI, and wrote several other passages that I had to cut. I will be adding those back, because honestly it flows better with them.This seemed to land very well with some people, and not so well with others. A few people picked up on some of the parts I thought might be too subtle, so that&rsquo;s good.Something about this story is telling me that it wants to be a comic. I&rsquo;m looking into making that happen.Week 5Title - After Hours at JD&rsquo;s Salvage YardPrompt- Who is the strongest person?I think the strongest person is one who continues on in the face of adversity. One who retains their joy even when it would be easier to let it go. Sometimes the strongest people are strong because they have help.This story started out as an action packed arm wrestling scene between mechs. I didn&rsquo;t get very far in before all I wanted to do was examine what sort of person would do that.I shifted everything over to a very simple scene where I could get to know Zenon.A lot of readers in my division didn&rsquo;t like this story (scene) very much, and that&rsquo;s completely okay. If you are reading this, and you didn&rsquo;t like it, that&rsquo;s fine. I didn&rsquo;t write it for you. I wrote it for me. I like to write these scenes to get to know my characters, and if everything goes well, I can start to like them.Zenon and JD will absolutely become characters in a new story, but it probably won&rsquo;t be this one. It might involve mech arm wrestling, and it might not, but it will be about dudes being good to each other. Even though the world around them might be a bit grimy, the story will be joyful.I&rsquo;ve started to put together what shape this new story will take.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tA few times on here, I have taken a little time to point out some graphics tools I like. Recently, it&rsquo;s just been a bunch of different ways to use Blender. I started using Blender for some stuff that I don&rsquo;t think it was really intended for, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to care. Just chews right through those graphics.This time, it&rsquo;s not Blender. This time I&rsquo;m going to write something about Pixel Composer&nbsp;( https://makham.itch.io/pixel-composer )There are about a million pixel art tools. Aseprite( https://www.aseprite.org/ ) is probably the current darling, and it&rsquo;s easy to see why. It does a lot. You can paint, edit, and animate with really intuitive tools. On the other hand, Aseprite is more a refinement of the sort of tools we have been using for computer graphics for decades now than it is something new or revolutionary. Most of the time, that&rsquo;s what people want. A tool that is dialed in for their particular task.Pixel Composer isn&rsquo;t that. It&rsquo;s a different sort of animal. Pixel Composer is more like programming pixel art pipelines than a traditional art tool. You string together a network of processes with whatever your input art is at one end, and some animated, distorted, or created pixel art comes out the other end. It has a lot more in common with procedural video compositing systems than it does with something like photoshop.It doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the best tool for every task, but it does make some workflows possible that would be very difficult without it. I suppose you could wrangle Blender into doing that sort of thing for you, but, try as I might, Blender can&rsquo;t be the tool for every job.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tSo, five weeks of writing flash stories, and I now have at least 3 good starts to stories I might be able to sell. I don&rsquo;t think any of them work the way I want in the form they are in now, but writing sellable flash stories was never my intent. I sort of just wanted to see if I could do it. If a few extra stories fall out the other end, well that would be nice too.I hadn&rsquo;t put it down here before, because it felt weird or braggy or something else, but after thinking about it, I don&rsquo;t know that it is. A few months ago, I applied to join Codex. Codex is a forum and community of neo-pro writers. People who have sold a few stories or completed certain writing courses. Some are full time professional writers, some are part time, or very part time, but all are more serious than hobby level. At least one person there is selling a story or a book ever few days. Dedicated discussions and resources on the ins and outs of professional writing (think basic contract and tax stuff) are almost as common as those on craft and technique. It&rsquo;s a place where writers hang out. I think I felt weird about talking about it, because I don&rsquo;t often feel like a writer. I&rsquo;m a commercial artist that sometimes pretends to be a writer.Fairly soon after I applied, they started running their yearly flash fiction contest. It&rsquo;s like a series of writing jams. All the writers are given a set of prompts, and a 48 hour deadline. You need to come up with an idea based on one (or a few) of the prompts and then execute it in under 750 words in under two days. I am quite familiar with game jams, so the vibe is similar. It&rsquo;s a contest in the same way that Ludum Dare is a contest. There will be a &lsquo;winner&rsquo; but no one outside codex will know or care, and there aren&rsquo;t really prizes. Well, maybe there are.The real prize, for me anyway, is that over a dozen other writers will read, comment on, and rate your work every week. I have a story published in a literal paper book and I couldn&rsquo;t tell you if a dozen people have actually read it. If they have, they certainly never told me about it. These stories are all short enough that anyone can buzz through several of them in a sitting. Little 750 word stories.That&rsquo;s the first prize, the second prize is that I will read more than a dozen (probably over 2 dozen) stories every week. I am getting a lot of exposure to what works and what doesn&rsquo;t in these short bursts.I suppose the aggravating part is, almost none of the stories I have read in the last few weeks have been bad. Some of them are so outrageously good that I can hardly believe they were written in less than two days. I take that back. It&rsquo;s not aggravating, it&rsquo;s inspiring. In an aggravating way.The scores and comments on my own stories have been mixed to slightly favourable. Every week at least one person selected my story as one of their favourites for that round, and every one of them has received a couple of 8 or higher scores. That might not sound great, but trust me, if you read these stories, being anywhere in the top half is extremely flattering. The stories are good, and some folks grade extremely harshly. There are at least half a dozen that I have read that can probably be sold, as is, with no edits. These people are that good.I just submitted my story for this week. I think it&rsquo;s okay, but we&rsquo;ll see. I think it would be better if it were longer than 750 words.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Choplifter!The best early 8-bit computer games did a lot with a little. They were written for computers built around MOS 6502 or Zilog Z80 processors. Moderately powerful chips at the time, but still absolutely dwarfed by the comparatively monstrous boards and chips in most arcade machines.There was never any hope that the graphics of an Apple II would come anywhere near to the graphics of a contemporary arcade machine. The frame rate would never be as smooth. The sound would never be as rich and full. An Apple II computer can do a wide variety of things, but being a match for any arcade machine would never be one of them.Maybe this is why a lot of the greatest innovations in gameplay arrived on computers first. If you can&rsquo;t match them on razzle dazzle, you better be able to make the game interesting in other ways.Choplifter! is a rare breed of game where the main objective is something ancillary to the main verbs the player has available.&nbsp;If I told you that you are controlling a helicopter that can fly quickly or slowly, pitch up or down, fly backward or forward, rotate to face in one of three directions, and it can shoot in any of them, what would you imagine the main game objective would be? If you picked flying around and shooting, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised. It seems obvious that the player would use those verbs to play the game.Other than flying, you don&rsquo;t really need any of them. It would be possible to play, and win Choplifter! never firing a shot and never rotating the helicopter.The main objective of Choplifter! Is to save as many captured prisoners of war as you possibly can. Not all, not a set amount. As many as you can. Maybe that&rsquo;s only one. Maybe that&rsquo;s all of them. Honestly, that&rsquo;s up to you. The game only demands that you save as many as you can.You could fly out, land, pick up prisoners, and take them back, while never engaging with any other verb in the game. Never pressing a button on the controller. It wouldn&rsquo;t be as much fun, but you could do it.Add to that, all the small interactions in the game. There are tanks, airplanes, and depending on the version you play, ground based cannons, and some sort of drone unit. You can choose to fight them or avoid them, and most of the time it&rsquo;s best to just avoid them. You can shoot open the prison huts, or get a tank to do it for you. Prisoners can be killed by tank fire, missiles from airplanes, your own shots, or just by landing on them.The best part about all of this interactivity is, you don&rsquo;t really need to engage with any of it to play the game. You will, because it&rsquo;s fun, but you don&rsquo;t need to. How you play the game is left to you.This is really what I mean when I say &lsquo;did a lot with a little&rsquo;. Sure, the processors and memory of those 8-bit computers were laughably small by comparison to today, or even the arcade machines of the time, but that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m getting at. Here is a game that is about a single objective. Rescue prisoners. But the way you go about doing that is extremely nuanced. You can shoot every enemy, or never shoot at all. You can pick up as many prisoners as your chopper can hold, or you can make dozens of small trips. The game doesn&rsquo;t care. There are a lot of tools here, and you can use them however you like.Choplifter! Lets you decide how you will play it, and that&rsquo;s almost always a recipe for the best games.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tOkay. Three weeks. Three stories under 1000 words.While I don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s getting any easier to write these things, I think, at least the last one, is a bit better than the others.Just like anything, if you practice a little, you get more comfortable with it.Gauging the pace of these sub 1000 word stories is tricky, but I think that&rsquo;s the part I am getting better at. I like to open stories rather slowly. Give the reader lots of time to acclimatize and get into whatever it is I am writing. That&rsquo;s not really a great way to write a story that only takes a few minutes to read. I still had to trim a little to get under the word count, but not over 200 words like the first week.So, what do I hope to learn by writing these? In such a tight word count, I can&rsquo;t be flowery or wander too far. I have to make sure my dialog gets to the point, or if I&rsquo;m doing my job right, several points. I&rsquo;m learning to echo concepts, without, I hope, making the text repetitive. I&rsquo;m learning that I can go from concept to finished story in a handful of hours, and I can do it repeatably. Reliably.I think that all of these stories will require several passes and probably more than a handful of additional words before they are ready to send out, but they are done. They are self-contained, functional stories.&nbsp;I think that&rsquo;s all I really aspire to write.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games Albums - Geddon Dangerous by Doublegeddon&nbsp;Normally this is the place for games, best games even. I&rsquo;m just going to drop a link here. If you are going to read this, you should at least have a listen to one of the best albums of last year.&nbsp;https://youtu.be/h-iUtkleVt8&nbsp;While you could just listen to this music and enjoy the blend of power metal and new wave synths, I don&rsquo;t know if you would get the whole experience.There are a lot of concept albums, but there are fewer concept bands, and only a tiny handful that make good music. Only really Ghost and Gorillaz come to mind.To sum up, Doublegeddon is, at least by their descriptions, two 5000 year old Sumerian demigods who have re-emerged from the 7th dimension to play metal music. One lives on the moon and one lives in Antarctica. Since one hates heat and the other hates oxygen, it works out.I&rsquo;m a sucker for satirical lore. Doublegeddon has it in spades.&nbsp;If you would like another link, here is an interview they did with a metal magazine.&nbsp;https://www.filthydogsofmetal.com/interviews/interview-with-doublegeddonAll of their songs are similarly silly, but with a narrative consistency that speaks to some real writing talent. The lyrics of Revenge of the Vampire sounds like a bunch of metal tropes laid end to end, but it&rsquo;s not just nonsense. The song tells a story. It&rsquo;s a goofy story, but it&rsquo;s fun, and good, and most important, well told.&nbsp;None of these songs are just tossed out there. The musical skill is obvious, but there is some real songwriting skill on display as well. Writing almost forty minutes of good music in service of a joke is worthy of applause.&nbsp;Jokes aside, Geddon Dangerous is just a really listenable album from end to end. I have put it on several times this year, and I will probably listen to is several more.I look forward to whatever they do next.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI just tried writing my first flash fiction. Flash is a story that is typically under 1000 words, but I have read that some people consider anything under 2500 words flash fiction. A while ago I tried writing a drabble, that&rsquo;s a story exactly 100 words in length. Here&rsquo;s something that might seem counterintuitive. Writing short is very hard.The story I wrote is less than 750 words, but I made sure that it had as many parts of a story as I could cram in there. There are defined characters, a goal, stakes, and a twist ending that seems obvious in retrospect. You know, story stuff.Packing any of that into 750 words is really tricky. This post is more than 400 words and I am only telling you about the story. I write outlines longer than 750 words.Flash fiction seems to be a popular format. Easily devoured by readers during a break or on their phone, but still long enough to deliver a compelling tale. I see a lot of other writers selling them. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m going to be among them. It&rsquo;s just really hard. I function better with a bit of room to breath. I often find getting under 5000 words to be difficult.The obvious question would be, if it&rsquo;s hard and I like writing longer stories, why try writing a flash story. The obvious, and correct answer, would be why not. You don&rsquo;t learn anything by not trying.I think I will try a few more in the coming weeks. I will probably find that I need to expand these stories quite a lot before I feel happy with them. On the upside, it seems to only take a day or two to write a 750 word story. That&rsquo;s a far cry from the weeks or months that I spend on my more than 5000 word stories. To be perfectly clear though, it might be a small word count and a short time, but it does feel much more difficult than writing a longer story.Unfortunately, like always, I won&rsquo;t be posting them here, unless I really can&rsquo;t see any way to sell them. I would like to. I would rather just post up anything that I write, but that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the way the publishing world works.Until it does, I suppose you will just have to be satisfied with these vague descriptions of what I am writing.Hopefully, in the near future, I can let you know about actual published stories I may or may not have coming out.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tAre you supposed to make resolutions for the new year? I don&rsquo;t really do that. I haven&rsquo;t done that since I was a kid. I don&rsquo;t really see the point.&nbsp;To be clear, it&rsquo;s not the resolutions, or the idea of making a promise to yourself and sticking to it. I love that sort of thing. I just don&rsquo;t understand the timing.&nbsp;This blog was a resolution of sorts. I wanted to write. I wanted to get better at writing. I decided that if, at the very least, I wrote one small thing every week, that would be good enough. I have continued to write, at least once a week, for ten years.&nbsp;Has it made me a better writer? Difficult to say. It has done this though. Now, I can write on demand. I can sit down and start writing. I don&rsquo;t have any delusions that the muses will work through me, or that I need to wait for inspiration. Writing, like drawing, is a practice of work. It&rsquo;s a thing you do and a process for doing it. The piece of writing you have at the end of that practice may or may not be good, but making something good instantly, and without revision, isn&rsquo;t the point. That&rsquo;s not writing.&nbsp;Drawing is a process of building up lines, finding the best lines in the noise, and refining those. 3D modeling is a process of building up forms, finding the best shapes in the noise, and refining those. There is a process for these practices that moves from undefined to precise in both of those arts. The only way to know how to select the precise shapes from the noise is by practicing. Moving through the process over and over and over again.Writing, it would seem, is much the same. You do it over and over and over and you get used to finding forms in the noise. The only way to do that is practice. Moving through the process. You resolve to do it. It&rsquo;s not a goal. It&rsquo;s a constant and unending practice.&nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t matter when you start, but there is no end. That&rsquo;s a resolution, at least for me. So, for this year, I think I will continue to do what I have been doing.&nbsp;Maybe I will draw a little more.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThis past week, I sold one story and received a request for edits on another.&nbsp;While that is pretty cool, I thought this might be a good opportunity to talk vaguely about editing.There is no guarantee that I will sell that second story, but they seemed to like most of it. They had some problems with the flow of the story and how it would work for their particular venue. I agree with them. I hadn&rsquo;t written it with them in mind, but for the way they work, there is a better configuration for this story.I don&rsquo;t know how other writers approach editing words, but I have done a lot of video and image editing, so it may come as no surprise, I work in a similar way with text. I like to take big chunks of story and reposition them on the page as if it were an editing timeline. Then I might pick individual words, phrases, or lines from one spot and move them to another, just to see how they would fit. I float paragraphs into gaps I have made and polish over the seams. That&rsquo;s just the way my brain works now. It has spent far too much time dealing with the visual side of storytelling and if I can provide it with a metaphor it understands, dealing with language goes much smoother.It was very heavily implied in the request for edits that some writers might not want to change anything about their stories. I get that, but my brain is also extremely used to making changes and revisions based on client requests. It&rsquo;s practically my default state. Making the first thing is difficult, but making changes is conceptually so much simpler for me. Again, this is absolutely from the point of view of someone who has been a commercial artist for decades at this point.Just like anyone, there are things I value in my stories, places where I won&rsquo;t compromise, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s out of some sort of quest for artistic purity. I always want to make whatever I&rsquo;m working on better. If the suggestion or criticism could make the image or animation or story I&rsquo;m working on better, I will almost always want to do that. If it breaks something core to the story, or changes it in a way that isn&rsquo;t making it better, I think I would be more inclined to dig my heels in.I don&rsquo;t think that &lsquo;going back to the drawing board&rsquo; is a thing that exists. People have too many internal biases and preconceptions. Once they see one version of a thing, erasing that and starting over truly fresh is not possible. That first experience will continue through the entire process. As will the second and third. Even if the final result doesn&rsquo;t resemble the initial idea, there is no escaping it. The only real way to edit anything is by moving forward through the process. Every change and revision, even deleting something, is forward movement. Not because that sounds like good motivational poster fodder, but because the past impacts the future. What you did before, what you saw before, what you wrote or read before, will change the ultimate result of your work.All of this is the long way of saying, I sort of like editing. It&rsquo;s like having a lot of clay to work with and only during the editing process do you start to define forms and clarify details. And it works with my brain better than coming up with the initial ideas.I&rsquo;ll stop writing this and go back to editing.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tLet's talk about stealing. Stealing ideas. It&rsquo;s what I do. If you write or code or make art or create anything, you probably steal too.I have written here several times about stealing game ideas from past games I have played. Writing is no different.When I write, I steal.I have probably read several hundred comic books, honestly, it could be thousands. Comic books, movies, and TV shows. More than anything else, these are the ideas I mine to fill my stories. Usually not the good stories either. I&rsquo;m not going to write my version of that one amazing Twilight Zone episode. I excavate the mine of the ones that could have been. The attempts that were partially successful. The seeds of ideas that never were.Almost every story I have written starts out with me trying to finish a story that never was. Some bit of a comic that I thought was interesting, but never explored. Some part of an anime that would have gone in a totally different direction had the creators tried to adhere to some sort of realism. I mean, I&rsquo;m glad they didn&rsquo;t. I watched whatever anime it happened to be so that I could see giant robots or punch wizards battle, but what a story it would be if they had just followed that other interesting thread.&nbsp;This is what I like to steal. Those ideas barely motioned toward and abandoned. What would happen if those stories were told fully.By the time I finish a story, that original seed of an idea is barely recognizable. Sometimes it has been excised completely. Maybe there would be a few other people who know where the original idea came from, but most of them are so thoroughly modified by the end that it would be pretty difficult to puzzle it out.I have a suspicion that this is how a lot of writers work. There have been a solid handful of excellent stories I have read recently that I could pretty easily point to what inspired them. That I could identify what they stole from didn&rsquo;t make the stories worse. In fact, sometimes it made them better. More relatable. More grounded.&nbsp;Everyone does the armchair quarterback routine when they see or read something that doesn&rsquo;t quite live up to the seed idea. Something that could have been a little better if the creator had only done that one thing that you thought of.&nbsp;While that probably isn&rsquo;t entirely true, I think this is the place that a lot of writers come from. What would I do if this was my story. The difference between writers and non-writers is only that the first group actually try it out. They write their version. They tell the story they way they would, even if the core idea is stolen from something else.&nbsp;So this is my direct endorsement for anyone reading this to go out and steal. Was there a bit of an old Star Trek or Columbo episode that you wish they had fleshed out? Write that story. Is there a bit of a comic or game or radio play that you can&rsquo;t shake, but no one else ever seems to care about it? Write that story. Run down that thread.If you don&rsquo;t make the thing that you want to see, it&rsquo;s unlikely anyone else will. They are too busy stealing from some little bit of story they can&rsquo;t let go. Go out and steal something for yourself.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Pitfall II : Lost Caverns&nbsp;1984 was a weird year for video games in North America. Atari was the dominant player in the industry by an extremely wide margin, and they were absolutely failing. Arcades were still popular, but some of the shine was coming off. Games were changing, becoming more complex. The hobby wasn&rsquo;t for everyone anymore. It was less accessible. Less inviting. Pong was a distant memory, and even Pac-Man had fallen out of fashion. Nintendo had already sold millions of Famicom consoles, and they hadn&rsquo;t even released outside of Japan. Home computers had never been more popular. The industry was simultaneously dead, dying, or poised to become the most lucrative entertainment industry in the world, depending on who you asked.As it turns out, it was the last one.Game developers never stopped. For all the talk of a market crash around this time, the innovation and creation of new video game experiences just kept rolling.&nbsp;Pitfall! Had been a real technical and artistic achievement. The Atari VCS wasn&rsquo;t exactly known for beautiful games. If a few blocks could move their way around a TV screen, that was achievement enough. If you went looking for legitimately pretty Atari VCS games, it might just be Pitfall! and River Raid.&nbsp;Pitfall! was a fairly simple game. Almost a proof of concept. A little stick man could be made to run across the screen in either direction dodging traps and jumping over obstacles. It was an adventure, in as far as it contained all the trappings of adventures. Dangerous pits, deadly creatures, swinging on a vine. Ultimately, though, there is no real adventure in the game. Just a series of procedurally generated screens for you to move through.&nbsp;Pitfall II is astounding for the time and a technical marvel for the platform. A year before Super Mario Bros. Pitfall II presented a true adventure. A game that reveals itself over many attempts and failures. The opening few screens of Pitfall II are unlike anything else on the Atari VCS. It teaches you how to play. How to explore. How the game will unfold. You will have to take risks. You will have setbacks, but those will teach you what to do on the next run.There are checkpoints that you will return to over and over. Reaching a new checkpoint is extremely satisfying. It&rsquo;s similar to finding a bonfire in a souls game. You now have an anchor, but you know that the next leg of the adventure will only grow more difficult.Pitfall II is an adventure game. Maybe one of the first. As you play through the game, attempting to retrieve some lost treasure while rescuing your niece and pet mountain lion, you will engage in an amazing variety of adventurey type activities. Every time you come across a new mechanic or a clever new environmental puzzle, it will be surprising and ingenious. All of this on a tiny Atari VCS cartridge.Because of when it was released, during the decline of Atari and right before the rise of Nintendo, Pitfall II is a game that was destined to be lost. It was ported to other machines, but never with the same magic. Something about the stark block color images and clean, precise gameplay make Pitfall II rise above almost all other games of it&rsquo;s era.If you haven&rsquo;t played it, and you probably haven&rsquo;t, you should give Pitfall II a try. It&rsquo;s one of the best games.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

It will look different, because, well, everything needs a change sometime. It will work in a slightly different way. If anyone is subscribed through rss I will try to make it seamless, or at least provide some forewarning before everything changes. \t\t\t\tThere is one other change that will be the biggest one, at least for me. This blog may not post every Monday like it has in the past. Usually it will. I am moving from a web based hosting wysiwyg editor to a markdown based system. That in itself isn’t a big problem. I can deal with writing a few markdown tags. The problem might be that if I happen to not have a usable dev environment available on any given Monday, or I haven’t managed to schedule my post beforehand, they might not get posted up until I get back to my pc.\t\t\t\tI know that not many people read this blog. Most likely, no one will notice if a post goes up on a Tuesday or Wednesday. I’m not too worried about it. I think I like the idea that I will have more freedom with how I create posts. Sometimes I might have to be okay with them not getting posted at the same time every week.\t\t\t\tRegardless of when posts go up, I still plan on posting once a week until further notice. This post marks 526 weeks. That’s over 10 years. If I was going to quit writing, I would have done it a long time ago. \t\t\t\t\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tOne of the benefits of having a massive library of classic arcade roms literally at my fingertips, is the art. Each of these games, thanks to all the people who preserve these sorts of things, has associated screenshots, flyers, cabinet art, and marques.It is pretty common for me to go through the game collection just to look at the different marque art.I was thinking about it, and arcades sometime between the mid 80&rsquo;s to the mid 90&rsquo;s are probably one of the most unique collections of visible commercial art.Places like grocery stores and department stores absolutely hold the record for most publicly viewable commercial art, what with every product having a logo or package design. But the difference with an arcade is that the art is there to sell you more art. Every game is, inherently, art. Every marque, every piece of cabinet decoration, is enticing you to come forward and look at a screen that will continue to provide more art. Visual art, audio art, animation, interaction. All art.Maybe a music or video store comes close, but neither of those are as immediate, as responsive. Arcades were a cacophony of art, and all of that art was made by people.A lot of video games came out between 1980 and the mid 90s. Every single one of them had marque art and backglass art. A lot of them had art up the sides of the cabinet. Some of this art is amazing. You know what wasn&rsquo;t very good then? Illustration software.I have made a lot of logos. Designed a lot, redrew a lot, modified a lot. I have worked with massive font libraries and I&rsquo;ve even made a few fonts myself. Every single one of them was created with the help of a computer. I have used Adobe Illustrator and Corel Draw and some more exotic illustration software that almost no one uses. I can&rsquo;t imagine what it took to come up with the design for the Pac-Man logo.   \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t          \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t          \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t \t   That&rsquo;s not entirely true. I have some idea. I have done some screen printing. I have hand cut vinyl and rubylith masks. None of that is particularly important, but trust me when I say that making the Pac-Man logo wasn&rsquo;t just a simple drawing or painting job. It would have been a very labour intensive and technical multi-step process. Of course, the digital files I look at know have been vector traced, color matched, and cleaned up when compared to the originals. Still, there is something wonderful about all of these designs and text treatments that had to be worked on by hand.I would never give up my Affinity Designer or other design tool. I have become accustomed to how they work, but I can appreciate how things were done before. The Pac-Man logo or the Galaxian logo, both amazing examples of modifying text to create something unique and eye-catching.&nbsp;If you go to a site like&nbsp;www.arcadeartwork.org&nbsp;and start poking around, you will likely be astonished at the amount of artwork produced for these games over the years. Peripheral art, for a game, that is, in itself, art. Stunning.&nbsp;This is just one particular venue for commercial art. Keep your eyes open and you will probably see so many more. Everything item that was made by people probably has some art associated with it. Somewhere, somewhen, somebody made a thing, and now you get to look at it. That&rsquo;s worth appreciating.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - WarlordsDo you like pong? Yeah, that two player tennis type game that you play by twisting a knob.Do you like Breakout? Yeah, that single player pong type game where you systematically smash a wall using a paddle and ball.Did you have more than one other friend?&nbsp;Warlords is what you get if you combine all of those things. It&rsquo;s pong, it&rsquo;s breakout, it&rsquo;s four players. It&rsquo;s great.In Warlords you control a small shield defending one of four castles nestled neatly in the corners of a regular TV monitor. A dragon sweeps in at the start of each game and let's loose a fireball. If the fireball hits a shield, it bounces off at fairly controllable angles. If the fireball hits a castle wall, it takes out chunks before bouncing off unpredictably. The harder the fireball hits, the more of the castle wall it destroys.Each player has a button that lets you catch the fireball and, more or less, direct the angle that you release it. This lets you turn another player&rsquo;s attack into a focused counterattack.When a wall has a large enough gap in it, and a fireball makes its way inside the castle, that player is out.The game continues until there is one Warlord left standing.Warlords is so simple you will pick it up in seconds. By the end of your first game you will already have started to develop strategies and, more than likely, rivalries.By the tenth game alliances will form. One player will be singled out as the strongest and everyone will gang up to take them out early. Deals will happen where two players will agree not to attack each other until one of the others is out.&nbsp;Warlords will turn friends into enemies and mild-mannered souls into monsters.You will likely enjoy every minute of it.Warlords is elemental and primal.Warlords works just as well today as it did in 1980 because it relies on the one part of the video game experience that hasn&rsquo;t changed. Other people.There is an AI that you can play against, and it&rsquo;s useful for filling out the board in the case that you are missing one of your four, but the game is ultimately unsatisfying when played against a computer. You need another person there that you can kick under the cabinet when they mercilessly toss fireballs at you.Because it exists solely to facilitate a good time, Warlords is one of the best games.&nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI&rsquo;ve got a few stories out for consideration at different outlets right now. They keep getting to the second or even third read stage before getting rejected. Most of the story review process is pretty opaque to writers submitting stories, and I think that is something that could definitely change with better metrics and tools, but the Submission Grinder gives you a pretty good idea of how far along in the review process a particular outlet is.The Submission Grinder is an amazing tool and probably the only reason I have been able to find and submit to as many outlets as I have. It depends on writers to track their own submissions, rejections, and acceptances, but even with incomplete data you can usually get a pretty good idea where your particular piece is in the process.You can see how fast they are moving through submissions, and in the case of a couple I have out right now, how far past the usual rejection window they are. If it&rsquo;s only a few days, that&rsquo;s probably just normal lag, and it might be that no one has read it yet. If it&rsquo;s a week or more, it&rsquo;s probably being reviewed by another person on their editorial team. If it&rsquo;s months passed the usual cutoff, either they lost it or you&rsquo;re going to be receiving a personal rejection letter with comments and maybe an explanation why they passed on it. While an acceptance would always be preferable, those rejection letters are better than the usual form letters.One could easily wonder why anyone would do this. Why would you spend weeks or even months writing a story just to have it be rejected over and over. I honestly can&rsquo;t say that I would recommend it. But, and this is a huge but, I think I am ok at this story writing thing. I think if I keep doing it, I could be very good at it. I haven&rsquo;t run out of ideas yet, and it doesn&rsquo;t look like I ever will. I might as well write them down and send them out. They aren&rsquo;t doing anyone any good if I just think about them.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Pang (or Pomping World or Buster Bros.)The early 80s were a time of wild experimentation for computer and arcade games. Game ideas would come from clever bits of code that someone managed to write in their bedroom more often than any sort of high level concept. If someone figured out how to create a smooth scrolling background, they turned that into a game. Figured out how to make it look like you are travelling down a road or tunnel by cycling colors or scaling sprites? That&rsquo;s a game idea. You can make a block or character jump when you press a button? Gotta make a game out of it.Two games, Galaxian and Asteroids, came out right at the start of the decade. There were about a thousand riffs on both concepts. A two dimensional shooting gallery and a game where you shoot one thing and it splits into two smaller things. Both of these games are built on extremely basic concepts and probably no small amount of clever code entirely unrelated to creating a game.It didn&rsquo;t take long for someone to merge these two ideas. In 1983 Hudson Soft came out with the game Cannon Ball for the Japanese MSX series of computers. A game where you guide a character back and forth across the bottom of the screen shooting ropes upward at bouncing balls. When you hit a ball, or a ball ran into one of your ropes, it would pop and split into two smaller balls. At some point fairly early in the development of the MSX computer, someone figured out how to make balls bounce. They thought, why not make a game out of that.Cannon Ball is pretty bare bones. It came out very early in the life of the MSX and what people were looking for out of their entertainment software was probably just that it existed and ran. Still, the core is already there.It would be another six years before Mitchell Corporation would do something that was rarely done in those days, they would license Cannon Ball from Hudson Soft to create an updated version. They would call this new version Pomping World. Typically companies would just steal game concepts and move on. Just ask Mitchell Corporation who&rsquo;s own concept for Puzz Loop would be lifted by Popcap to create Zuma. You could ask them, except Mitchell Corporation shut down only a few years later.Treachery of the game industry aside, have a look at these two games. I think old MSX Cannon Ball polished up quite nicely.   \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t          \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t          \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t \t   In Pomping World (later retitled Pang) you direct a character left and right across the bottom of the screen and fire ropes upward. There are balls bouncing around up there and if you hit one of them it will split into two smaller balls, or bubbles. The object of the game is to clear out all the balls and their debris, without the character being hit by any of them.While Pang does offer a nice graphical upgrade over Cannon Ball, the main difference between the two games is the power-ups.&nbsp;You start out only being able to fire one rope projectile that disappears when it touches any barrier. You can pick up a power that lets you fire two ropes, one that lets you fire a rope that grapples in place, only dissolving after a set amount of time unless it&rsquo;s hit by a bubble, or a gun that fires quickly but leaves no ropes behind that you can use as barriers or shields.&nbsp;That&rsquo;s the main mechanic in Pang that makes it different from something like Galaxian. When you shoot a rope up the screen, the bubbles can crash against the side of it and pop. That means, ropes aren&rsquo;t just an offensive weapon against the bubbles. You can fire one and then step to the side, putting the rope between you and any bubbles coming to hit you. It&rsquo;s not enough to just aim up-screen like you would in Space Invaders. In Pang you have to plan for bounces and deal with the smaller bubbles when the larger ones burst. It&rsquo;s an action game that boarders on the strategy of a puzzle game. There are other power-ups that play with time, but none of them are an instant win. They all have upsides and downsides that you will have to get used to if you want to succeed.Pang, and it&rsquo;s sequels, are such simple and refined games. It takes a few minutes to develop a winning strategy. After a few more minutes you will discover that strategy was terrible and you will develop a new one. This will keep happening for as long as you play the game.&nbsp;Pang may be one of the last games that sprang directly out of some clever thing that someone figured out how to do on a computer. Game development now is a much wider field. If you can think something up, there is probably a way to do it. Some clever person probably already has.&nbsp;Pang is truly one of the best games.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI had planned to write about a fun old game this week. Or maybe I would have called an audible and wrote something about writing or submitting or art or how inspiration can come from anywhere and it&rsquo;s great to use your diverse interests to feed your art.Instead, I think I will write a very small amount about harassment. Online harassment to be specific.We hear a lot about online harassment, and I don&rsquo;t know if you know this, but the internet is not different from real life. It is a connected and shared space. It&rsquo;s not physical, but actual people are on the other end of every interaction you have. They are very real, and they can, and often do, react in very real ways to the things that you do or say.I write all of this, because this week I was harassed online. Well, sort of online, sort of in physical space. The details are, frankly, too stupid to reiterate, and the incident is over, but the anger, and even fear, I felt were very real.I know that what I experienced is an absolute sliver of what people being systemically harassed experience. I also know that I will never suffer the way some people do. There is very little that any individual online can actually do to me. I did nothing to earn it, but I have a certain amount of armour, built of age, cultural privilege, and means. It makes me a very poor target. For one, I have the privilege of feeling and expressing anger rather than fear.Not everyone has that armour. People I know and care about might not have that armour. And that was the part that made me the most angry.I&rsquo;m extremely lucky. I can laugh this sort of thing off. I spent a few tense hours communicating with people I know and preparing a defense that I knew I would never need. That was all. Nothing really. I will likely not come across an individual this misguided again, and if I do, the incident will likely follow this same pattern.What about people who don&rsquo;t have that armour? What about people who for whatever reason wouldn&rsquo;t be able to talk to administrators, or management, or police? What about all the people who might have a legitimate need to keep a private life separate from their online one?There are far too many people who could have been put in personal or professional danger from the sort of thing that just happened to me. I wish that everyone could be so impervious, but the fact is, they are not. And the internet is real life. Things said and done on the internet are real.I know that I can&rsquo;t do much to stop harassment from happening. I can attempt to shield my friends and family from it. I can try to ensure that the shared spaces I occupy are free of bullying and harmful attacks. I can intercede on others' behalf, because, let's face it, I might not deserve this armour, but I do wear it.Online harassment is real. It&rsquo;s not lesser. It&rsquo;s not different. It can, and does, cause actual harm.If you also wear this armour, use it. Make the spaces you share on the internet safer for those who don&rsquo;t.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI finished the first draft of a new story. The first draft of anything is going to be lacking. It&rsquo;s going to have typos, and missing words, and rough edges where the prose doesn&rsquo;t flow. There are pacing issues and maybe even missing details, details that, were they there, would bring the story to life in the mind of the reader. I know this, and still I want it to be great right away. I want it to work the first time.I draw. If you have read any of these posts previously, or you have known me for any length of time, you probably know this. I have drawn since I was very young. Every single time I make a mark on paper or activate a collection of pixels, I want it to work perfectly the first time. I want every mark to be perfect. They aren&rsquo;t, and they have never been. I want it, but I know that&rsquo;s not how it works.When you draw anything, it usually helps to start out with a sketch. Some simple marks that won&rsquo;t be part of the final image, but give you anchor points to build an image around. If the picture is a person, I like to create a line of action. One or two marks that represent the characters balance or movement in the image. Then I like to create certain anatomy landmarks. The rigid and immutable parts of a person work well. The skull, the rib cage, the positions of the joints. After that I build up the mass of the form. Muscles, fat, hair, clothing, etc. This is what gives the character their silhouette, their unique shape. Then I go in and create detail that defines that character.&nbsp;I continue to do the same for every element of the image. Structures, machines, animals, garbage, all of it. Everything is built of layers, and every layer is dependent on the one before it being strong and accurate. But it isn&rsquo;t only a one way process. Sometimes the shape of a hand will define the base structure of an arm and the line of action through the shoulder and down through the hips.I only know this because I have been making drawings for a long time. Drawing for a long time means I have learned to trust this process. I know that it will get me from a blank page to a finished drawing.Every single time I still think, this is the one where I do it all perfectly, right out of the gate. I won&rsquo;t need a strong pose, because everything will work the first time. I won&rsquo;t need to create landmarks because all the details will just be in the right place.That never happens. So, instead, I trust the process. I work through the steps. I refine the drawing in stages.I just finished writing a sketch. I haven&rsquo;t been writing like this nearly as long as I have been drawing, so my path forward is a little more hazy, a little less practiced. But I know that I have a sketch. I think it&rsquo;s a strong sketch, but I will have to move some landmarks. Maybe the line of action isn&rsquo;t exactly balanced yet. I&rsquo;ve been starting to develop a process for this, but it will take time. For now I just have to think that it will get there. It will be a finished story. It might take more than one pass is all.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWhen I started writing this blog, it was a sort of dev diary. I didn&rsquo;t post once a week and I titled, rather than numbered, each post. While I thought that no one would likely read what I wrote here, on the off chance that they might, I tried to make it a somewhat pleasant experience. Somewhere along the line, I decided to both switch to one post a week and stop worrying that people might read it. That&rsquo;s why the posts are numbered rather than titled, and I sometimes repeat myself. Like right now. I have written a very similar thing in an earlier post, but I don&rsquo;t think that anyone has read all of them, so I can probably slip it by without anyone catching on.There was one other thing that I decided when I switched to one post a week. I decided that this would be a place where I advocated for good things. Usually that takes the form of commenting on Best Games, video games from the past that are great and deserve praise and recognition. Usually those games are fairly old, and have had countless articles and other, more important, blog posts written about them. I don&rsquo;t like to Best Games a game that is new or current or &lsquo;hot&rsquo;.I&rsquo;m going to break that trend here. Also, I&rsquo;m not advocating for a game this time.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s pretty rare that the first few minutes of a TV show make my eyes go wide. I like a good show, but even when they start strong, most shows will have a lull in them that makes me think &lsquo;oh, the creators of this didn&rsquo;t think that hard about this part. It&rsquo;s just filler until they get to the next set piece&rsquo;.&nbsp;The new Andor Star Wars show doesn&rsquo;t do that. Every shot matters, and every bit of background minutia has been considered. This is a TV series made by people with a deep love of Star Wars, but also by people with a deep love of stories. How stories grow and build. How one moment that seems inconsequential, but still sticks in your mind, can become the spark for wonderful, powerful scenes down the line.This is a TV show that expects you to pay attention. You have to bring yourself to the material. There are things happening when the camera isn&rsquo;t on them. There are characters saying things counter to what they mean. There are threads working through the background, and you have to keep them in mind while watching a scene in another locations with other characters.Now, they could easily fumble this show. They could have a great setup and fail to pay it off. But I don&rsquo;t think so. There is too much care and affection in this show. The creators know where it&rsquo;s going, and all the steady pacing is deliberate. When those threads start to entangle with each other, I think the payoffs will be well worth it.When the first episode ended I wanted to cheer. This was a Star Wars show made by people who love Star Wars and it was like they were saying &ldquo;just go on this ride with us, it&rsquo;s gonna be great&rdquo;.I&rsquo;m on the ride and so far, I&rsquo;m loving it.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Super Puzzle Fighter II TurboThe time between the creation of Tetris and someone wanting to play Tetris competitively, in head-to-head fashion, is probably nanoseconds. At first, players would have been able to play against each other's scores. Who got the most lines, or who could reach a certain score in the shortest amount of time, or who could beat Alexey at his own game. When you are working with soviet era computers, I&rsquo;m sure you took what you could get.Once the game was on more capable hardware, like the NES, it was inevitable. The official Nintendo version of the game didn&rsquo;t have competitive multiplayer included, but the Tengen version did. There is an entire story behind that, but I&rsquo;m not writing about Tetris today. I&rsquo;m writing about Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo. A game that might be the pinnacle of head-to-head puzzle games.When you are playing a head-to-head game, say a fighting game, or Chess, or Battleship, it is assumed that each player starts out on roughly equal ground. Now, one player can work very hard at getting good at the game giving them an advantage, but just based on the rules of the game, neither side of the board should have an inherent advantage. Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo is the ultimate expression of that.Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo is VS. only. Even if you play by yourself, you will be matched up against a computer opponent. There is nothing zen or meditative about this game.Like Tetris, Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo is a game about dropping things into a well. In this case, the things are gems. If you stack up a bunch of the same color, they become larger gems. There are also special exploding diamonds. If you drop one of the same color on a column or series of connected gems, they all break. The ability to combo those gem breaks into other gem breaks is the very core of Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo.As the name might suggest, this game is part of Capcom&rsquo;s fighting game renaissance. There are chibi versions of characters from the Street Fighter and Darkstalkers games that give Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo an attraction that the gem based gameplay might not otherwise have on its own. It wouldn&rsquo;t have needed it. The game is that strong.Here is where it&rsquo;s a different sort of puzzle game than Tetris. If you play VS. Tetris, the most skilled player will almost always win. The one who has had the most practice. Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo is more intuitive than Tetris. It&rsquo;s more improvisational, more dynamic. After a couple of games, a new player will probably give an experienced player a serious challenge. It&rsquo;s a game with almost no learning curve, and a variety of strategies to victory. In that way, it is something like a fighting game. It is very difficult to get yourself into a hole so deep that you can&rsquo;t dig yourself out of it with a series of good moves. It&rsquo;s likely that you can set yourself up to deliver a powerful attack almost by accident. This is a game about taking advantage of the opportunities before you, not necessarily strategizing your way into them.I could be wrong. There could be an extremely high level of play in Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo where combatants plan many moves in advance. That has never been my experience. This is the accessible, party friendly, head-to-head puzzle game.&nbsp;Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo is a great game to introduce to people who don&rsquo;t really play games. Simple to pick up, and fun to play, really it&rsquo;s just one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWhenever I start a new story, I open two documents. The first one is the story I&rsquo;m trying to write, and the second is all the bits that I want to keep, but cut from the story for one reason or another. I usually call this document &ldquo;cut bits&rdquo; because I am extremely inventive like that.As I go, I will usually add a few more documents. One to hold research or stuff I copied and pasted from Wikipedia. Maybe a timeline or a document with relevant full names, just so that I don&rsquo;t forget them. But most of the work happens in those two documents.&nbsp;Most of the time I wind up with the cut bits weighing in at roughly half the word count of the finished story. I probably deleted some stuff in there that would never be used, or pasted back some stuff after I found a place for it.The story that I am currently writing is only a bit over 3000 words, but the cut bits document is well over 3500.Now, I don&rsquo;t store drafts in cut bits. This isn&rsquo;t a bin to put all of my previous versions. I use a sort of version control for that. Cut bits is only for stuff that I can&rsquo;t use right now, but I like the flow of a certain sentence or paragraph, so I keep it around to see if I can use it later. So I haven&rsquo;t just typed in more than double the words, I have written, and discarded more than double the words in the story.These are different words. Different paragraphs. Entirely different ideas that might still fit in the current story.I don&rsquo;t think this is a six or seven thousand-word story. This is a fairly short story, but I have had so much trouble with it that I have had to try it several different ways.&nbsp;I still really like it though. There is something good in this story, but even after writing more than twice the words it needs (actually seven or eight times when you take the revisions into account), I haven&rsquo;t quite nailed it. It&rsquo;s very close, but it&rsquo;s not there yet.&nbsp;Maybe this week.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Lode RunnerThe first version of Lode Runner I ever played was on the Atari 800. Then I played it on a Commodore 64. And then on an Apple II. And then on a PC. I just played the Arcade version on a Steam Deck. And then again in a browser.In every single case, Lode Runner is brilliant.Developed by Doug Smith, allegedly Lode Runner was based off a recollection of a retelling of a kid&rsquo;s time at an arcade playing Space Panic and a somewhat failed attempt to recreate Donkey Kong. Lode Runner and Space panic share the ability of the main character to dig holes and have pursuers fall into those holes, but that&rsquo;s about it. Where Space Panic is an action game, Lode Runner is a puzzle game through and through.I think that&rsquo;s what makes Lode Runner so special. It&rsquo;s a puzzle game, where you might have to play a little action game jazz to arrive at the solution. Juking and dodging are tools just as vital to your success as planning and strategizing. This ain&rsquo;t Donkey Kong either. Moving in one direction and dealing with threats as they come to you won&rsquo;t help win a level of Lode Runner.Lode Runner is a game about stealing gold, including gold that guards might pick it up as they pursue you, escaping, and then stealing all the gold on the level. Sometimes you can approach the level in a haphazard manner, and sometimes only a perfectly precise path will solve a specific level&rsquo;s puzzle. You won&rsquo;t know what sort of level you are on until you fail at it a few times. Since the game has something like 150 of the things, you aren&rsquo;t likely to get bored. And even if you do, Lode Runner has a remedy for that.Lode Runner is one of the first games that shipped with a level editor. You could make your own levels, or modify the existing ones, to make any sort of challenge you want. The real joy of this feature would be to see your friends attempt to beat difficult levels that you created, unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t have any friends with an Atari 8bit computer, so I just made weird levels for myself. Not gonna lie, it was still fun.More important than the level editor, or the hybrid, action, puzzle gameplay was what Lode Runner meant to game design in general. While there eventually was an arcade port, Lode Runner isn&rsquo;t an arcade game. Lode Runner takes advantage of the environment in which it is experienced. Lode Runner is a computer game. It expects that you will be at home, on your computer. You will try one puzzle room again and again to perfect it. This is one of the earliest games that understands where it is and how that changes the way you play it. Lode Runner is undoubtedly an influence on later home console games like Legend of Zelda, games that are built around a different way of playing. A different pace. A different level of focus. This is a game that isn&rsquo;t content to only hold your attention for ten minutes at a time. This is a game that knows that you might have hours to devote, and it lets you.Type Lode Runner into a web browser and go play any of the many html5 versions out there. You won&rsquo;t be sorry. It is one of the best games, after all.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tSometime in the early 90s, I was flipping through channels and stopped on this amazing movie. I didn&rsquo;t know what it was, I didn&rsquo;t know how long it had already been running, and I barely knew what anyone was saying.I watched all of it.It was Wim Wenders 1987 film, Wings of Desire. It had just started, it was in German, French, and English, but it was playing on the French channel so I could only get so much context from the subtitles. It didn&rsquo;t matter. It was absolutely wonderful.&nbsp;A few years later, I watched it again, only this time with English subtitles. Aside from a few minor subtleties, I hadn&rsquo;t really missed any of the core story or themes that first time. It was a movie you could watch without understanding most of the lines, and it still made sense.While I think that Wings of Desire is a fantastic movie and you should probably watch it, if you haven&rsquo;t, praising it isn&rsquo;t the point I&rsquo;m getting angling toward.Wim Wenders understood the medium of film so well that he made a movie you could love without understanding any of the languages spoken in it.I&rsquo;ve played a few games, video games, recently that don&rsquo;t seem to understand the medium they are working in. Where movies have to tell the story visually at least as much, if not more, than through dialog and description, games have to tell theirs through interaction.The game Disco Elysium is incredibly dense with text and voice acting. It&rsquo;s several novels worth of words and description, but it wouldn&rsquo;t work without the interactive element. Creating the character, and the world, through your choices is at the core of the game. Everything is built around the interaction between the player and the systems of the game.Several recent visual novel style games, on the other hand, have you click through a series of paragraphs that are delivered in an extremely linear style. This is the same level of interaction as turning the page of a book. Just because the player presses a button, does not mean that the interaction was meaningful or core to the experience.I won&rsquo;t ever go so far as to say, or even imply, that this makes these games bad or unenjoyable. There are a lot of people who dearly love the stories told in these visual novels. They are not wrong. The stories could be amazing, but the medium isn&rsquo;t being used to enhance the experience. It&rsquo;s a mismatch.Wings of Desire held my attention for two hours because it used every part of every frame to tell the story. It is a movie, through and through.Games are a much younger medium, so maybe the vocabulary hasn&rsquo;t been fully developed yet. They are also a very important and impactful medium. There is so much yet to do in games. So many interactive experiences and stories. But to do it, I think it&rsquo;s important to ask &ldquo;why a game?&rdquo; as opposed to a book or comic or film. If it&rsquo;s difficult to answer &ldquo;why a game?&rdquo;, maybe what you are making is something else.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWe&rsquo;ve had the Steam Deck here for a while now. It&rsquo;s a great machine. We have played a handful of modern games with it, but, in all honesty, I mostly play old games on it. Mostly Street Fighter.I did play Street Fighter using a gamepad for a while when I first discovered Mame and other emulators. But not for very long, and not seriously.I built my first arcade stick in about 1998. I have had an arcade stick or arcade cabinet ever since. At times, a couple of them. If I wanted to play arcade fighting games at any time in those years, I played on an arcade stick.Any time I played a fighting game on a gamepad I didn&rsquo;t really have a feel for it. I would swap back and forth between the stick and the D-Pad, never really finding my groove with either. I wouldn&rsquo;t know how to map the buttons, so I would end up putting my heavies on the face buttons and just never using my medium punch or kick. It was so foreign to the way I was used to playing. I could get a fireball or hurricane kick to come out once or twice per match. Dragon punches? Forget about it. I just could not get my thumb to perform the movements.The convenience of the Steam Deck has changed how I play fighting games. I think I will always prefer an arcade stick (bats not balls), but I think I get it now. I am incrementally catching up to all those kids who played a ton of Super Street Fighter II Turbo: Hyper Fighting on the SNES. I can crank out fireballs all day on a DPad now. I can even get the dreaded dragon punch to come out 9 times out of 10.I am not now, nor will I ever be, a master at fighting games, but I still have fun playing them. I crank up the computer difficulty pretty high to make the early fights more difficult (though that does mean that the cpu does some pretty wild stuff that a human could never do) and I am getting more and more good wins with gamepad style controls. I still get stomped a little past halfway through the arcade campaign, but that is sort of intentional. These games were made to eat quarters after all.I knew that we would use the Steam Deck to play current games, and I knew that I would put emulators on there and use it to play older games, but I didn&rsquo;t really think that it would change the way I play one of my favorite genres. I have a noticeable callus on my left thumb from doing quarter circle swipes.Maybe I can use it to understand the charge system in Art of Fighting. I doubt it.&#8203;\t\t"

I have three short stories in various stages, one in the early edit and rewrite stage, one extremely early with only a concept and outline jotted down, and one that has been reworked so many times I&rsquo;m not sure if it will ever get finished.&nbsp;I have four stories submitted to a few magazines, but it could be literal months before I get a response back from any of them.I also did a little more work on the draft of the novel I started during National Novel Writing Month. That will still take a while before it&rsquo;s ready for major edits, but still, some movement is good.And that&rsquo;s writing. It&rsquo;s slow. It&rsquo;s mostly rejection.

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Street Fighter Alpha for the Game Boy ColorThis game has no business playing as well as it does on a Game Boy Color.&nbsp;I bought a Game Boy Color in 2001. The Game Boy Advance had just come out and people were rightly more interested in the new handheld machine than the aging hardware of the Game Boy Color. I think I paid roughly $50 for it, and it came with a multi cart full of games. I remember playing a bit of Pok&eacute;mon, a lot of Link&rsquo;s Awakening, and more Street Fighter Alpha than I ever thought I would.I tried the Game Boy port of Street Fighter II on a friend's Game Boy once, and found the experience frustrating. Nothing worked right. The inputs felt off and everything ran at around ten frames per second. I think I played a couple matches before giving up.I figured that the Game Boy was just not the right platform for a game so kinetic and demanding. Street Fighter Alpha proved that assumption wrong.Whenever I write one of these, I always try to find a way to play at least a bit of the games that I am writing about. Often, I think a game would be a great candidate for a Best Games post, and find that raw nostalgia is not enough. They might have been interesting diversions at the time, but some games just don&rsquo;t hold up as classics. In other words, they aren&rsquo;t actually the best of games. I believe Street Fighter Alpha for Game Boy Color deserves a little context here.I have been regularly playing a few rounds of Street Fighter III: Third Strike and Street Fighter Alpha 3 on a handheld device. These are arcade accurate. Tough act to follow. Not being able to find my old Game Boy Color, I tried Street Fighter Alpha on the same handheld, and it is absolutely breathtaking.The pixel count and color pallet are extremely limited on the Game Boy Color, but the game is unmistakable. It looks and, more importantly, moves like Street Fighter Alpha. There are only two buttons, but the developers have somehow managed to fight most of what makes a fighting game work into those limited inputs. Specials, Supers, Counters, they are all in Street Fighter Alpha, and they work just like you would expect.I went and looked up who could have executed such an amazing port. What I found was both astonishing and unsurprising.The Game Boy Color port of Street Fighter Alpha appears to be mostly the work of two people. A tiny team managed to pack all this game into a tiny amount of space and processing power. It seems impossible until you look up the other things that they worked on.&nbsp;Keith Burkhill is a British programmer that worked on some of the smoothest, fastest, and most technically impressive ZX Spectrum games. The ZX Spectrum was never a powerhouse, so lots of tricks had to be employed to get games to run well on a speccy. Kevin McMahon worked on some of the fastest pixel art games of the early 90&rsquo;s.There were probably a few people or teams that could have created a port as good as this one. I would guess that most of them had experience working with the extremely tight constraints of early home computers.It might be fair to say that the title of Best Game should go to the original arcade version of Street Fighter Alpha, but I think that the ability to carry a game of this quality in your hand changes the way you relate to it. There was nothing else like it at the time, and while it was missing multiplayer, it truly felt like playing a good game of Street Fighter.The Game Boy Advance would go on to have many spectacular ports of fighting games. Possibly the most impressive is Street Fighter Alpha 3, and it may come as no surprise that it was worked on by the same people.At the twilight of the original Game Boy, there was no better way to play Street Fighter in your hand than Street Fighter Alpha on the Game Boy Color. An achievement, and still one of the best games.       \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI was going to post up a painting today. That was the plan.I try to sketch or paint a bit every week. You know, just to keep limber or whatever.I had a stint there where I was only really drawing when it was directly related to something I was working on. A concept sketch or a color study. Something quick and dirty that I would eventually turn into a 3D model or a vector illustration. One of the steps along the way, with no plan to create a final image.The thing with doing anything repeatedly, you get a bit better at it. The drawings or paintings that I scratched out were good enough for my own exploration, but not really representative of the final model or scene. I did a bunch of drawings, got a bit better, and now I&rsquo;m not really satisfied with what I paint.There is a plateau that every artist hits. I know that I have hit it multiple times over the years. You&rsquo;re good enough that you can sort of make what you imagine in your head, but you aren&rsquo;t good enough to meet your own standards. Most artists just sort of learn to live with it. Once you hit a certain level of skill, you will never be satisfied with the quality of your work. So maybe it&rsquo;s not fair to call it a plateau. I don&rsquo;t think that my skill at drawing or painting is not improving, I think that I will always be reaching for a bit more than I am currently able to do.&nbsp;So, long story short, I painted some stuff, I was going to post it, but I don&rsquo;t like it. I&rsquo;ll work on it some more and see if I like it next week. Maybe like is a strong word. See if I find it acceptable next week.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of stuff with procedural textures recently. I think that might be the way everything will have to go in the future.&nbsp;3D graphics have gotten progressively better, more detailed, more reactive and interactive. Light bounces around in realistic ways, or if you like, unrealistic ways. Graphics cards can dynamically increase and decrease the resolution of models. We don&rsquo;t really use that feature very often, but it exists and works fairly well.One of the last frontiers of dynamic, resolution independent graphics, is the texture.If you want to change the color of a surface in a 3D game or movie, one of the easiest ways is to apply a texture to it. It&rsquo;s like an incredibly versatile sticker. It can be sliced up, moved around, rotated, adjusted, and animated. Everything that you can think to do to an image on a computer, you can probably do to a texture. Usually in real time.The thing you can&rsquo;t do is zoom in forever. There is a maximum number of pixels that you can store in a texture. If the texture you use to wrap a 3D surface is of a lower resolution than that image takes up on screen, you will see those pixels. If a player gets real close to a surface, they are going to see those pixels.I don&rsquo;t think this is really a problem, and most people who play games seem to agree, but there will come a time that being able to see the pixels won&rsquo;t cut it.There are two paths to go here. Bigger and bigger textures, or procedurally created materials that scale as they need to. The first one takes memory, the second one takes processing power.For a long time in graphics, memory, or the time it took for a machine to swap images in and out of memory, was cheaper than processing. With textures already being made regularly at 4096x4096 the options for just making them bigger are sort of running out. Not only will we run out of memory to store huge textures, but we will run out of the ability for a person to meaningfully use that higher resolution.I think the path over the next few years will be to use more small images in procedurally blended ways. Three, relatively tiny, grass textures mixed together to cover thousands of meters of plains terrain. Metal constructed surfaces made of a miniscule handful of textures covering huge surfaces with no visible repeats.&nbsp;These materials are more complex to assemble, but they can take less memory while taking advantage of the massive amounts of processing power graphics cards have on tap.A lot of these techniques are being used already in non-real time applications, but more and more this will be the path forward for games and VR content too.If PBR setups were the revolution of the last decade, procedural materials will be the art creation workflow for the next decade, at least.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - CameltrySometimes games get lost. Even great ones.A singularly brilliant idea and design, a game that should have spawned endless sequels and copycats, just disappears.&nbsp;Cameltry is one of those. A forgotten gem.The game itself is beyond simple to describe. A marble is dropped in a maze. The only thing the marble will do on its own is fall. The player of the game has no direct agency over the marble. The only thing the player can do, is spin the maze. By spinning the maze, you direct the path of the marble. Get the marble to the goal, repeat on the next maze. That&rsquo;s the whole game.There are, of course, some additional wrinkles. You have a limited amount of time to reach the goal. You can press a button to hop the marble a bit, or hold it down to speed the marbles fall. There are different obstacles and bonuses spread through the mazes that you will need to deal with.         There is no story to speak of. No indication of where the name comes from. There is an appearance from a goddess of space and time, but the reasons for that are never provided. None of the backgrounds seem to have anything to do&nbsp; with the maze game happening in front of them, and none of them seem to be connected to each other. The strict, beautiful, mechanics of directing a ball through a maze is the only through line for Cameltry, and that&rsquo;s all that it needs.The game, designed at Taito and released in 1989, sets out to do one thing, and does that one thing so extraordinarily well. It is almost unbelievable that we aren&rsquo;t playing Cameltry XV right now. And yet, here we are, living in a world where most people have never even heard of the game.&nbsp;When the arcade game got its eventual computer and SNES ports, it was renamed On the Ball. A slightly more memorable name, but nothing that stuck as a franchise. There was a version for the DS and iPhone called Labyrinth, but none of them gained any traction.Maybe it&rsquo;s because the game is so singular, so perfectly unadorned and uncomplicated, that no one ever tried to resurrect it or create new versions of Cameltry.&nbsp;It could be argued that something like Monkey Ball might be a spiritual successor to Cameltry, but that&rsquo;s a stretch. I think that maybe the game was so perfectly formed on the first version that no one ever tried to improve on it.&nbsp;Lost or not, Cameltry is still one of the best games.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI wrote a story a few years ago that I keep wanting to go back to. It was a short little thing. Maybe 1500 words or so. It felt like a lot at the time. Now, I can&rsquo;t sum up a single thought in less than 500.I liked that story, but there was a major problem with it. It wasn&rsquo;t actually a story. It had a start and middle, maybe, but that was about it. There was no end. There was no conclusion, nor was there really any plot. It was like a scene from a larger story that I never wrote. A character study with nothing for the character to actually do, or feel, be about. Just a sort of story-stub. Something that could be a story, if I was a better writer.I don&rsquo;t know if I am a better writer now, but I am, at least, a slightly more confident one.As these things usually go, I thought of a way to actually write the story I had been attempting back then while I was writing a different story. The end result of working on story ideas, is always coming up with story ideas. They just might not always be for the story you are working on right then.&nbsp;I decided to have a look at the old story and see if I could just punch it up a little. You know, give it a bit of a rework without actually rewriting everything. I&rsquo;m thinking you can guess how well that went.This will be a better direction and I might have a usable, maybe even sellable, story at the end of it, but it needs some major work to rebuild. Or, if this is a story-stub, a blueprint, then maybe this isn&rsquo;t so much of a rebuild, but an actual build.I could keep writing this vague and meandering thought salad, never saying exactly what I am working on or what the story used to be, or I can just go and write it.I think I will do the second one.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tOver the last week I taught my kids some 3D modelling in Blender. The task was to go from zero, downloading and starting Blender for the first time, to making a model and then printing that model on the 3D printer. I thought we might be at it for a week or two. It took them about three days. Four if you count the day of downloading and setting up Blender.I started learning 3D modelling over twenty years ago. Tools and processes have improved somewhat since then.&nbsp;The idea that someone could come to something like Alias Power Animator (the first pro level 3D software I ever used, at least the one that wasn&rsquo;t AutoCAD) and make an object that would be prototype manufacturing ready in three days is laughable. Those were not user friendly tools at all. There was an expectation at the time that if you were ready to pay the tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars to use 3D software, a little bit of a learning curve was to be expected.&nbsp;Strange that Blender, a program that is available for free, is a positive breeze to use by comparison. There is an inverted ratio of usability to money spent.Of course a lot of that ease of use is just due to time. User interfaces have gotten better, more intuitive, over the years. Computers have gotten more powerful and the software more capable. I will give myself a small amount of credit. If I hadn&rsquo;t used a variety of 3D programs over that 20-25 year period, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to field the questions they had or present the material in an easy to understand way. And when I didn&rsquo;t know something (which happens a lot) I know how to look it up, so I taught them that too. That&rsquo;s probably the most important skill I could impart.We now have a couple of new printed plastic dodads in the house. I&rsquo;ve shown my kids enough that they should be able to make more. I can&rsquo;t wait to see what they come up with.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Dig DugPac-Man and Rally X have a lot to answer for. They spawned a genre so pervasive that, at one point, nearly all new arcade games were maze games. Not until fighting games would we see one genre so heavily over-represented in the industry.The video games industry, with all its diversity of ideas and themes, is very much not immune to chasing trends. In fact, if there is one thing you can be sure of, any time there is a hit game there will be some sort of riff on that concept coming down the pike in short order.&nbsp;When maze games became popular, you could be pretty certain that any and all types of maze chase games would be available soon.There is another thing about the video games industry. It&rsquo;s extremely iterative. If there is a good game out there, not only will there be a copy or clone available soon, there will also be new and interesting twists on the concept.&nbsp;Dig Dug is what happens when you make a maze chase game, but you take out the maze, and dramatically reframe the chase.In Pac-Man, you spend most of your time running away from pursuing ghost monsters. The corridors are unyielding, and you need to plan a head to stay just out of reach of the ghosts. Occasionally you can turn the tables for a few moments, but only a few.Dig Dug removes the maze. You can go anywhere you want. Dig any patch of dirt. You create the maze. While you do move slightly faster through air than dirt, you are not constrained in any real way. That&rsquo;s genre flip number one.Genre flip number two? You aren&rsquo;t running from the monsters. The player character, Taizo Hori, is easily the most dangerous thing on the screen. The monsters are running from you.&nbsp;While the monsters outnumber you, they will try to be aggressive and chase you down, but you can pretty easily dispatch one monster. Even two is not much of a problem. You simply pump them up with your bicycle pump until they pop. Comical, but not exactly non-violent.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s only when you are swarmed that the monsters have much of a chance against you. You need to play smart to out maneuver them. Force them into tunnels that lead them right to you, or drop carefully timed rocks on their heads. If you plan well, you can crush a whole group of cartoon monsters under the same rock.This is a maze chase, but you are the one doing the chasing.&nbsp;These simple changes to the genre lead to a game that is far more strategic and thoughtful. You aren&rsquo;t reacting. You are setting traps. You aren&rsquo;t prey, you are the hunter. You are corralling and managing space.&nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t hurt that Dig Dug is a cute and borderline delightful affair. There is a jaunty tune that plays every time you take a step, but stops when you stop. This gives the player a subtle nudge. If you keep moving, the music keeps playing, so you should always be moving. Moving, planning, scheming.&nbsp;Dig Dug is not just another maze game. It&rsquo;s a jazz remix of maze games, a stylistic bit of genre bending. Dig Dug is what happens when a developer doesn&rsquo;t slavishly follow the trends, but instead plays with them.&nbsp;More than that, Dig Dug is one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

No matter how hard or easy the first and last lines are, everything in the middle is terrifyingly difficult. You can have the start and end all worked out and still there will be issues with the middle.Where do you start? Where do you end? What do you do in between?I suppose you start with something strong. Something that grabs attention. Something that invites them in.Then you absolutely must end with something that will stick with them. Something that sums up everything before, but also leaves room for more.Simple.In the middle, you go from thing to thing, but not in a boring way. You can never be boring in the middle. Even when you absolutely need to. Even when there are things you need to say that aren&rsquo;t as important. At least not important to that one person. You know the one.

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI&rsquo;ve had the Steamdeck for a couple of weeks now. I have a few different thoughts about it. Mostly, it&rsquo;s cool as hell, but only if you like messing with hardware and software.I happen to love messing with hardware and software. I dig into some flavor of Linux about once a year. Not enough to remember everything, but just enough that I know I can usually fix what I break. If any piece of hardware has some sort of secret menu or hidden configuration, I will probably try to get into it. If, for example, my TV had a hidden menu, I would fiddle with it. It did, and I have.It&rsquo;s not that the steamdeck has a lot of secret stuff built into it. There is all sorts of hidden stuff, but it&rsquo;s not really secret. It has a standard Linux desktop tucked neatly under the veneer of a user-friendly, steam only, interface. Dropping into desktop mode is pretty trivial, but if you aren&rsquo;t used to that sort of thing, it might be like getting access to a vast trove of power you weren&rsquo;t ready for.Just like any Linux PC, you can install a lot of extra, non-steam stuff. Mostly that means emulators. And boy, does this unit ever run emulators.I have probably played more SNES, Genesis, Dreamcast, Gamecube, PS2, and arcade games on it than modern games at this point. It&rsquo;s an amazing Rocket League and HardSpace Shipbreaker device, of course, but it plays a mean game of Street Figher 3 as well.&nbsp;Setting up emulators and other games on it is as simple as using any Linux based PC. Mostly, you just download and launch them. Not much to it. At least not much to it if you like doing that sort of thing.I have had an issue getting some of the controls to work properly with Dark Souls 3. You can configure almost everything on the steamdeck, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it will work flawlessly. It works pretty well, but, like any PC, it has quirks. Sometimes things just won&rsquo;t work the first time, so you will have to dig in and adjust some settings or tweak config files. The battery life isn&rsquo;t great, but it&rsquo;s probably adequate for most uses. With all these caveats, it might not be right for the person who wants a console like experience. For me, it&rsquo;s fantastic.I haven&rsquo;t set everything up on it yet, but so far I really like it. If you enjoy fiddling around with technology, a Steamdeck is a pretty neat toy.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThis is just a short update on how writing is going.Right now I have two short stories out for consideration, three more that are nearly done or in editing, and another one that was finished quite a while ago, but needs a rewrite in a few areas. I&rsquo;m thinking it might be a numbers game.Of the rejection letters I have received recently, a couple have been the usual form letters, but a couple have been personal and outlined why they were being rejected (and no, I won&rsquo;t be saying what outlets or magazines these are, mostly because it doesn&rsquo;t matter, but also because I will likely be sending them more submissions in the future). In two of those cases, the editor sending me the rejection letter said it was because the story didn&rsquo;t fit the format or theme of the issue, but they asked for future submissions. While this could have been a case of someone trying to be polite, or spare a writer's feelings, they probably would have just sent a form letter if they actually didn&rsquo;t like it.In the case of at least one of those rejection letters, I have to grudgingly agree. I mean, I like the story, but it would sort of be a stretch to imagine it fit with the theme of the collection they were putting together.Here is the problem. When they ask for more submissions, that&rsquo;s nice and all, but I don&rsquo;t really have that many pieces of writing just sitting around waiting to send out. In the grand scheme of things, I haven&rsquo;t really been writing fiction very long. Only a few years of serious effort, and maybe two years actually trying to sell the things I write. I just don&rsquo;t have a big backlog of pages to dive into. And I very much don&rsquo;t have submissions ready in a lot of genres or in different themes. For example, I don&rsquo;t really have any horror stuff. I think that&rsquo;s because I find a solid ninety percent of horror short stories either not scary or not interesting, and I can&rsquo;t think of a good way to appeal to the people who do like those stories. What I find scary is more slow creeping dread, than shock and gore. That stuff usually gets flagged as literary fiction and not specifically horror. More Twilight Zone, less Tales from the Crypt.Whatever the case, I will probably have a couple more stories submitted for consideration over the next couple of months. Maybe that will increase my chances of selling another one. Like I said, it might be a numbers game.&nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Bagman1982 was a pivot point year for video games. Games like Pac-Man and Donkey Kong were still riding high. To any arcade operator or game seller, it would have seemed like video games were on an unstoppable upward trajectory. Arcades were making money. Atari and Coleco were raking it in with their home consoles. Even home computers, like the Commodore 64, were driving huge game sales.&nbsp;There was a slight snag for a year or two after that. Honestly, no one could have predicted it. Atari was the biggest player in the industry by far, and they over extended. The floor fell out, and for a hot minute it seemed like video games might be just another fad. If you were designing an arcade game set to be released in 1982, you could be excused for trying to make something a little more ambitious. Something that no one was doing. Something that players wouldn&rsquo;t be ready for. If you were making an arcade game in that heady environment, you might make something a little weird. You might make Bagman.Bagman, or Le Bagnard, is an action platform game made by French developer Valadon Automation. In it, you direct an escaped convict around an old mine in a mission to gather up your stashed loot, stuff it in a wheelbarrow, and cart it off screen. It&rsquo;s a very simple idea, and it could easily have been a riff on Donkey Kong, or a clone of Space Panic, but it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s an entirely different sort of beast. Bagman might be the world's first systems based game.Maybe that&rsquo;s a stretch, but maybe it&rsquo;s not.&nbsp;Here are some things about Bagman. It&rsquo;s a game played with a joystick and one button. With that stick and one button you can, climb ladders, pick up money, drop money, put money in a wheelbarrow, drop a bag of money on a guard from the top of a ladder, push a wheelbarrow, grab a mining pick, put down a mining pick, scare a guard with a mining pick, hit a guard with a mining pick, hang from a beam to avoid a minecart, ride in a minecart, garab a bag of money while riding in a minecart, and ride an elevator.More than that, the state of the multiscreen mine is saved between lives. If you get caught or fall, all of the bags you have moved stay moved. It&rsquo;s a small thing, but it also means that the game is built on independent systems that interact with one another in predictable and player influenceable ways. This was an extremely uncommon way to develop games at the time.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s sort of unbelievable that you can do so many, context-sensitive things in one game using only a stick and one button. Not only that, but so many of those actions combine and overlap. Bagman is one of the first &lsquo;If it looks like you can do it, you probably can&rsquo; games. There are unique bits of animation and sound that kick off when you trigger most of these actions, but it&rsquo;s really sort of amazing that you can do them at all. This was in the era of very simple arcade games that could be understood and played in seconds.You might think that all this interactive complexity would make Bagman difficult to learn or understand, but it is just as intuitive as a game like Donkey Kong. Your goals are clear, and when you mess up, you know it&rsquo;s your own fault.So why then is Bagman not up there with Donkey Kong in the list of fondly remembered classics?There are two reasons.First, there might be a lot of ways to interact, but there are almost as many ways to get caught or killed. The game is incredibly difficult.That difficulty is probably to the game's detriment. Sure, it probably gathered a lot of quarters, at least for a while, but that sort of variety of player driven interaction wouldn&rsquo;t be seen again in a game for a few years. Had it been even just a little easier, more arcade goers would have played it, and more developers would have tried to copy it. Maybe that doesn&rsquo;t make the best short term business sense.&nbsp;Second, It&rsquo;s too easy. I know I just said that it was too difficult, but, like a lot of systems based games that would come later, there are ways to exploit that difficulty. Exploiting games usually means being very patient and taking your time to do everything. If you are willing to pick up a bag, move it a few steps, put it down again, use the pick for a few seconds, and then start moving the bag again, you can finish the game&rsquo;s, single level. If you are very patient and willing to play for somewhere between twenty to forty minutes, you probably will finish it. Your time playing might not be the most exciting to watch, but it will be full of near misses and well planned escapes. Depending on how much you like exploiting systems, this could be a bad thing, or a very good thing.I think that we have seen, time and time again, that letting the player win is a good business strategy when making games. Letting them win in a way that is satisfying and makes them feel like they earned it is even better. We did get a Super Bagman, but it was more of a minor iteration on the theme rather than a full evolution. I wonder what an entire series of Bagman games might have been. What could have been done with that innovative layering of actions and systems during those early stages of the industry. I suppose we will never know.Regardless, Bagman is one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThis will be a short one. I&rsquo;m really just here to praise the graphical Swiss army knife that is Blender.So, a little bit ago, I was working on some textures. The task was to pack a non-alpha grayscale image into the alpha channel. Non-alpha, in that it wouldn&rsquo;t be used as transparency data for the image. I figured that a channel was a channel so how hard could it be.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll back up slightly.Sometimes, when working with textures, especially for realtime 3d applications like games, you want to pack as much information as you can into each texture. Standard image files are made up of three or four channels. The Red, Green, Blue, and sometimes Alpha channels. Usually, each channel is a grayscale image that represents&nbsp; steps from black to white, the contribution of each channel's pixels to the final image. If one pixel of the green channel is one hundred percent white, then the green contribution to that pixel will be turned up as high as it can be.&nbsp;Now there are a lot of perceptual issues that mean that some images have higher contributions from some channels, or they apply different falloff curves to different parts of the color spectrum, for simplicity&rsquo;s sake, let's just say that each channel has a full range of 128 or 256 steps between black and white for each pixel.There is nothing saying that you need to use those grayscale channels to build up parts of the same image. What if you have three, entirely different, grayscale images. Rather than using up all three channels of one texture, why not pack all of those into a single texture file using the R, G, and B channels. If you have a fourth one, you can pack that into the alpha channel. At least that&rsquo;s what I thought.Channel packing using the R, G, and B channels is pretty trivial, and pretty much any image editor will let you do that. Packing stuff into the Alpha channel proved to be a bit more difficult.&nbsp;The Alpha channel is usually used for transparency. Same rules apply, though. It is a grayscale image that controls how transparent or opaque each pixel is. The problems happen when you make a pixel 100% transparent.Most image editors are pretty smart. They will try to infer what you are trying to do. If you convert an image from say, RGB color format to CMYK for printers, there is a set of steps and conversions that the image editor will go through to try to keep the colors as accurate to what you intended as possible. The same thing happens when you set a pixel in the alpha channel all the way to transparent. Most image editors will set that same pixel in the R, G, and B channels to zero as well. It makes sense when you think about it. If you are saving that image out with a bunch of zeros, data compression schemes can shrink the file quite a bit. Only problem is, when you are trying to do channel packing, you don&rsquo;t want to lose that information.Now, not all image editors did this. Some kept all the info, but had other issues. They couldn&rsquo;t read the input images properly, or they couldn&rsquo;t create an output image properly. They didn&rsquo;t work with the formats I needed, or they lacked support for linear color space (sort of a must for some texture work).After trying all the standard image editing tools I have, and it&rsquo;s not an exaggeration to say that I have an awful lot, I found that only Blender did everything that I needed. Not only that, but it did it better and easier than any of the others.&nbsp;I will qualify that &lsquo;easier&rsquo;. Blender can look like the control panel of a 747 and it has functions buried under its function, but if you happen to know how it works, you can mix and match and mess with images in a truly unrestrained way.I used the compositing part of Blender. It&rsquo;s intended to be used to layer rendered or filmed images, blending them and adjusting them until they look seamless. It&rsquo;s the sort of software used to piece together visual effects sequences in movies. Because of that raw image manipulating power, it&rsquo;s also uniquely suited to ripping apart and reassembling textures in the most amazing ways.I created a pipeline that split all of the channels and then recombined them in any way that I liked, and any set of images that I used as the input could be run through the system and recombined. Not only that, but Blender works with damn near any image format that you could imagine, and it&rsquo;s all hardware accelerated. I could rip apart massive 5K textures and put them back together into uncompromising .EXR files (without a doubt, the best image format that people have come up with), in literal seconds.I don&rsquo;t know that a tutorial on how to do it is exactly warranted here, but this is a picture of the node tree that the textures run through.Blender is really one of the best things to happen to graphics in a very long time.       \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI want to talk about sci fi doors. Okay, this is important.&nbsp;Actually, you&rsquo;re right. It is super not important. It&rsquo;s silly. But I just want you all to know that I have a real problem with sci-fi doors.Before I get too far ahead of myself and start ripping on some artist's work, I know, I get it. I&rsquo;m an artist too, and I have made a lot of sci-fi nonsense. Greebles and patterns that really don&rsquo;t mean anything on machines of indeterminate function. I do it a lot. And I will do it again.I get it. I understand. Designing something that looks futuristic and interesting is tough. There are only so many techy looking crates and boxes a person can think up before things start getting weird.I do have a real problem with doors. Sci-fi doors. Some of ya&rsquo;ll got to get it under control when you are thinking up doors.Every single one of you has used a door. There is just no way that you are this far into an art career that you have been given the opportunity to draw, paint, model, or construct sci-fi decor and you don&rsquo;t know that form and function of a door. It&rsquo;s just not possible. You have used a door.I went and typed &lsquo;sci-fi door&rsquo; into google image search. Go ahead, try it now. Type that in. An awful lot of them look similar, don&rsquo;t they. You know what they don&rsquo;t look like. Doors.&nbsp;Doors might be one of the most practical and least artistically adorned bits of architectural technology that we have come up with. They are never overly fancy, pokey, or embellished, because people will be interacting with a door on a near daily basis. They are usually pretty smooth. They have one extremely obvious interaction point. If they have hinges and rotate on those hinges, they have to be fairly light or at least well balanced. You know what I didn&rsquo;t see in several pages of the google image search? A door on hinges. You know what most doors in the world have? Hinges. Even most doors in space and at sea have hinges. Because hinges are practical and reliable and if the door breaks, those hinges are easily accessible and repairable. You can make a solid airlock or water seal with a hinged door. Doors on hinges are good and useful, so I doubt that we will abandon them in the future.Look at this regular ass door.         Not only is this door easy to understand, but depending on the frame it could also be watertight or even airtight. It could be fire poof, bulletproof, even blast resistant. This door probably has most of your door needs covered for centuries.&nbsp;Okay, so let's just say that we have figured out a really amazing and robust sliding door mechanism in the future. They are more reliable than elevator doors and we can install them everywhere. Fine. Maybe prefabricated doors that slide into a bulkhead or some other sci-fi structure can be made cheap and common. Totally fair.Have a look at this thing.&#8203;         Again, I don&rsquo;t want to drag this artist. The modelling work on display here is pretty good. The material work is nice, and the color scheme is pleasant enough. But what the absolute fuck is going on here. How do I open this? Why are there so many angles and shapes? Why do the white paint lines cross multiple panels? Is it supposed to blend into the rest of the wall? Why are there so many bits you could catch your sleeve or finger on? This door looks like it&rsquo;s always a little bit greasy. Or it might give you tetanus. Whatever it is, this doesn&rsquo;t look like a practical door.&nbsp;That door isn&rsquo;t an outlier either. I didn&rsquo;t pick it just to make a point. It was literally in the top row of images when I typed sci-fi door.So was this.         Why is the edge lit up? Wouldn&rsquo;t it make more sense to light up the latch or handle? Which brings us to, where is the latch or handle? Who knows. Maybe it&rsquo;s an automatic door. If that&rsquo;s the case, what are all those indents and shapes for? Does it have really high cat flaps? Are there multiple peep holes? Do you have to be close enough to read the text before the automatic door sensor goes off? I don&rsquo;t know about you, but 99% of the automatic doors I come across are pretty smooth. Because there is no need for all that other crap. Smooth is all it needs to be to do its job as a door.If you thought those were odd, have a look at this.&#8203;         This door looks like it intends to open me up. I can&rsquo;t even guess how this thing slides or pivots. Maybe it&rsquo;s like a transformer and it unfolds into an entranceway. I feel like someone said sci-fi door and this just manifested. Like calling for the Candyman.Again, and I can&rsquo;t say this enough, I am not ripping on the art. Making any of these doors is tough. It takes work. What I am questioning is when did we decide this was what a sci-fi door looks like. What in the past several centuries makes us think that we will deviate so wildly from current trend of door technology. Doors are one of the few things we as a species have really nailed. Our doors work very well.It&rsquo;s not all terrible.Have a look at this         Other than have a jog in the split of the door for some reason, it&rsquo;s not bad. There is a clear touch pad or entry system off to the right. There is a door mat for you to wipe your feet on. The light is aimed at the entrance so you can both see the door and, presumably, the occupants can see on video who is at the door. Surface adornment is kept to a minimum. Access panels might hide the workings of the door for maintenance or upgrade. All in all, a well considered door. Even if it is of the slidey variety.Have a look at this one.         That looks like a regular old, hinge door. Pretty basic. Functional. Recognizable. There is no doubt, it&rsquo;s a door.So, here is my plea. If you find yourself designing some sci-fi thing in the future, don&rsquo;t overdo it. If the thing is a kettle, it&rsquo;s okay if it just looks like a kettle. Doors can look like doors. Shoes can look like shoes. These are things that won&rsquo;t change a lot as we venture out into the stars or to the depths of the ocean or across dimensions or whatever. A door can look like a door, and that is good enough.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Karate ChampNow hear me out. What if a game could be one of the best games ever made while being completely broken in very fundamental ways? What if a game could have innovative, even revolutionary, controls while being terrible to play? What if a game could represent a tectonic shift in what multiplayer games could be, while mostly coming down to random chance?Without Karate Champ, we don&rsquo;t get a Street Fighter or a Street Fighter 2. Without Karate Champ, there is no Mortal Kombat. Karate Champ represents a fundamental shift in how arcade games could, and would, be made.If Karate Champ didn&rsquo;t exist, we would have to invent it.Karate Champ (or Karate Do in Japan) is a one on one fighting game released in 1984, well before fighting games were a genre.&nbsp;It is a game that aims to be as much a simulation of a sport as it does a martial arts fantasy. In the single player mode, the player alternates between rounds of one on one fighting with computer opponents, and challenge stages where you have to break pots or bricks or fight a charging bull. It&rsquo;s weird, but it all works as a piece. All at once, regional Karate tournament and martial arts action movie.In the versus mode, you use all of those same Karate skills against a real live human on the same cabinet. It can make for very fast, fun, and dynamic matches.The innovation in Karate Champ is, without a doubt, the control system. Most arcade games in 1984 used one joystick and one or two buttons. Any layout that varied from that template usually meant you were in for a wildly different game.&nbsp;A couple years earlier, Robotron: 2084 operated with two joysticks. That game was a fairly standard move and shoot type game, but the two joystick control scheme allowed players to move in one direction while shooting in another. It was the game that created the twin stick shooter genre.Karate Champ used that same control system, but combined the stick movements together in a sort of macro. The left stick was primarily used for moving your Karate combatant around, but when you chained movements on the left stick with directions on the right, you could pull off all sorts of authentic looking Karate moves. It introduces pull back to block. It includes high, middle, and low attacks. If you pull down on the right stick and up on the left, you can do a forward flip that can put you on the other side of your opponent. There are moves that attack behind you. There are jumping kicks. Link all of this with the ability to fight a real human opponent and, make no mistake, Karate Champ is a fighting game.&nbsp;Karate Champ, out of the gate, incorporates so much of what would become the core of modern fighting games. It was an arcade hit, but it could have been massive. A cultural totem. It comes up short in one area, otherwise we would probably be playing Karate Champ 8 at EVO now. It&rsquo;s the one thing that fighting games wouldn&rsquo;t get right until Street Fighter 2. It&rsquo;s really hard to hit anything.The collision system for Karate Champ is odd. Often, your fist or foot will pass harmlessly through your opponent. Then, every once in a while, a strike that seemed to end a few pixels before them will land. In a game where it only takes two solid hits to win, it feels far too random. The hits, when they land, are solid and satisfying, but it could be anyone&rsquo;s guess whether they will land at all.Street Fighter 2 is far from any sort of simulation of fighting. There are a lot of strange impact shenanigans that happen every match. It is also extremely rare that a punch that looks like it hit, will whiff. You can always be reasonably sure that your range is right for a particular attack. It feels like what you try to do, you can do. Karate Champ is just too much of a constant dice roll. The same kick at the same range may or may not hit depending on the frame of animation your opponent is currently in.&nbsp;If you played some chess, but on every turn three of your pieces went into a quantum superposition between two other pieces, it would become impossible to play. You wouldn&rsquo;t know, until you made your move, if a piece was a pawn or a rook. If you lost, it wouldn&rsquo;t feel fair. If you won, you would have no idea how to repeat it. That&rsquo;s what playing a lot of Karate Champ feels like. A constant game of guessing if the thing you are doing with your hands will have the desired effect on screen.I&rsquo;m certain that there are people out there who have become deft at playing Karate Champ. Not nearly so many as there are for Street Fighter 2. It&rsquo;s a matter of expectation and consistency. If you swirl the controls in a certain way in Street Fighter 2, you can be pretty sure what will happen. Not so for Karate Champ.This is another one of those almost games. Arcade experiences that point the way to huge things in the future. I think it&rsquo;s fair to say though, without Karate Champ, we may never have developers explore the one on one fighting space. It does so much right, and it is still fun to play. It came up inches short of being revolutionary.Maybe it&rsquo;s only for historical reasons, but Karate Champ is one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWe just got back from a trip to Disneyland. We&rsquo;ve been a couple times, and I always wonder at&nbsp; their ability to design spaces. If you have done any game development, or even if you&rsquo;ve just played a lot of games, you will know that most of game design is moving people from one place to another, one task to another. Doing that smoothly, interactively, and enjoyably, is arguably the core of game design. If a menu is difficult to use, if an interface is tricky to manage, people won&rsquo;t play your game. If there are too many unintuitive moments or situations, people will quit playing. Difficult puzzles and complex interaction take a distant backseat to the more common knob twiddling and button pressing that players are required to do. It&rsquo;s these spaces between the &lsquo;gameplay&rsquo; where most players fall off. The people who design Disney&rsquo;s parks are absolute masters at this. If the rides and shows are the &lsquo;gameplay&rsquo; getting people from one to the other is the game design of a theme park.&nbsp;I have written a little about how they use eyelines and the transitions between spaces to guide your experience. That&rsquo;s probably what most people will notice and comment on. The physical movement from place to place. You usually won&rsquo;t be able to see one area or land from another. Structures will block your view until you get pretty close to another area, and even then the transitions can take you by surprise. This makes you feel more immersed in the land you are in, but it also makes you feel like you are discovering things just by walking. You turn a corner, or pass under an archway, and suddenly you are in a whole new place.&nbsp;This manipulation and crafting of physical space is amazing, and it&rsquo;s worth studying if you are at all interested in how game levels work. Especially if that game level has to accommodate hundreds or thousands of players. I want to focus on something else. A little bit of UX that disney has really refined.Information. It would be easy to just provide all information at all times. A lot of seasoned game designers often say that you should provide as much information to the player as you possibly can, and then let them decide what to do with it. Like most things, it&rsquo;s never that simple, and the user experience can sometimes be improved by withholding some information. I will provide a couple of examples I noticed during this last disney trip.First is the most obvious bit of information. The length of ride lines at Disneyland is posted at the entrance gate to each ride. This is something they have been doing for some time. They break the times up into five minute increments, but if the board says five minutes, that really means you can just walk right on. Anything from fifteen minutes to thirty minutes will probably be shockingly accurate.Now this bit of information can do a few things. First, guests of the park can decide if they want to wait in line or not. Lines to ride popular attractions are a given, so some amount of waiting is expected. As the time to ride increases, the amount of people who are willing to wait decreases. Only the most popular rides will ever have line times longer than an hour. There are so many other attractions at the park, you might as well head off to one of the other ones. Just this little bit of information will naturally spread guests around the park, and get people to try out less popular attractions.That bit of information does something else too. You can see most of the lines snaking out from the rides, but people are extremely bad at estimating. If you looked at the line to, say, The Haunted Mansion, it would be difficult to judge the difference between a half hour long line or a one hour long line. Often, parts of the line are out of view of the path, so you wouldn&rsquo;t even be able to count the people if you wanted to. Ride operators will adjust the length of the line by opening and closing different loop-backs and u-turns. Visually, the lines can be very deceiving. The shape and space of the lines changes from ride to ride as well. Something that looks like a very long line on one ride might only be a few minutes on another. Those boards will help you decide how to spend your time at the park. Pair that with the phone app that provides you with the same information about ride wait times, and you have the makings of a really powerful queue and crowd management system. All you had to do is provide the information.The next thing is maps. Disneyland has a distinct lack of maps. You know those ubiquitous mall guide boards? Yeah, Disneyland doesn&rsquo;t have any of those. You can certainly grab a map from the information booth, or you can look at the one in the phone app, but everything in the park is set up so that you don&rsquo;t need one. If you follow any path, it will loop back around to the main hub. Every path, eventually, feeds back into the central ring of the park. This means, if you know where it is you want to go, you are probably never very far from it. But also, if you don&rsquo;t know where you want to go, and this is the important bit, you can just keep walking forward to inevitably see all of the park. You could just walk around and experience a constant sense of discovery. There are no maps, and almost no road signs to direct you. They want you to feel like you are exploring and discovering. Because that makes simply walking around fun. There are lots of little alcoves and cul-de-sacs to find. All of them designed specifically for discovery.If there were waypoints and road signs that pointed you directly to Space Mountain, there would be a lot of park goers who would miss other attractions.So, here we have two very different examples of how to use information. Deliberately providing or withholding information can change user experience for the better. Disneyland has had decades to get it right, and for the most part they do.&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t even get close to talking about how they pack ride lines into ridiculously small amounts of space, or provide a show experience while you are in line so that wait times don&rsquo;t feel as long. I think I will go over those at some point, but these two bits of informational experience design should be enough to chew on for now.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBlender has a new-ish feature called geometry nodes. I won&rsquo;t be doing any sort of tutorial or how-to about it here. I have done a few things with it, but I don&rsquo;t have any level of expertise that I would feel comfortable sharing. At best, I might be able to explain it.When you are modelling something&hellip; let&rsquo;s use an example. Say you were modelling a drink vending machine. This is a vending machine that needs to be able to work, or at least look like it works. There is one of those little drink elevators and a bunch of slots that hold all of the beverages. This is the sort of thing that you could model traditionally. You could make all the parts. Find out what the average vending machine sizes are and scale a box to that size. Design each of the drink bottles or cans. Create a marquee and set up an array of lights behind it.If you only need one of these drink machines, that&rsquo;s it, you&rsquo;re done. What if you need a handful of them? A few different sizes, different marquees, all with different drinks and different lights burnt out behind the marquee.You could set up a few of them. But how many? Six? Twelve? How many different vending machines would it take to ensure that when you spread them out over an entire city, no one would be able to see the repeats? Each machine would seem unique.Geometry nodes is a way of programming your models. You create a set of rules that spit out models, and then you can have it randomize the results. You can either feed the system a selection of prebuilt parts, or you can have it build the entire thing from a single vertex on up to a full object. The system incorporates the material nodes system as well, so you can have the surface color and texture change along with the model. You can have it swap out the type of drinks, what slots are full or empty, how many drinks are in each slot. There really is no end to it.Every time the generator runs it will create a new vending machine based on those rules.&nbsp;Geometry nodes can be more complicated to set up than regular, straight ahead modelling, but the end result can create a dizzying array of assets.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not a tool that needs to be deployed in all cases. There are probably a lot of assets that are better built as one off models, but some things, things that are repeatable objects with slight, but important variations, could make excellent use of this tool.Like I said, I&rsquo;m not going to do any sort of breakdown of it, but I did use geometry nodes to create a system that can make any sort of rail line, or road, or path, or really anything that is roughly a repeated object along a curve. And it works.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI love to pick apart stories. Not to criticize or poke holes in them, but like tearing down a machine, I want to see how they work. Or don&rsquo;t. How setups are paid off. How motivation is sold. Or isn&rsquo;t.We watched The Batman. I liked some of it. I didn&rsquo;t like other parts. That&rsquo;s not really important. I&rsquo;m not going to review the movie or give it some sort of a score. If you want to want to watch something and be entertained for a couple hours, you could do worse than watching The Batman. When you open it up and start looking at the parts, there are some places I think they could have done better.&nbsp;When I hear or read a critique of a story where it becomes clear that the person forwarding the criticism simply wanted a different story than was being told, I always bristle a bit. I&rsquo;m not going to do that. I think the story, as they were telling it, is fine. But it could have been much better. The problem they have is with familiarity.&nbsp;At this point, there should be very few people who would go to see a Batman movie who don&rsquo;t know who Batman is. In fact, this movie is counting on it. They make reference to the Wayne family in ominous tones, but they never explicitly say what happened to Bruce Wayne&rsquo;s parents. Because they don&rsquo;t have to. They know that you know. They know that you know this character. They know that you know minute details about the crime families of Gotham. They need you to know, or this story doesn&rsquo;t work. The success of this story, of this movie, depends on it.And then they somehow forget.I&rsquo;m going to point out three scenes, three key moments, and this will get very spoilery. I&rsquo;ll toss in a fourth for good measure.The opening monologue is overwrought and emo, but it&rsquo;s done in a fun and knowing way. I can let all that pass. It establishes that we are in a heightened reality. What you are about to see can be corny in an earnest way and as long as you are on board with that you might be in for a fun ride. That&rsquo;s great. It establishes that tone and sets up the audience for the story to come.&nbsp;During the opening monologue, Bruce Wayne as Batman tells us how he uses the shadows and fear as a weapon. We see miscreants scatter at the sight of his bat signal. Good stuff. Batman stuff. They know that we already know this and are attempting to meet our expectations. So far, so good.We see a group of thugs accosting an innocent man. The writers also know that we know, Batman will always defend the innocent. That&rsquo;s what he does. Our expectation is that he will show up to protect this man. They meet our expectations, but there is something wrong with this scene.Batman does show up, but he pretty much just walks forward and punches them all. Fair. It&rsquo;s a well done action scene. The punching looks sufficiently punchy. But we just heard how he uses the shadows and fear as weapons. This guy just marched forward and punched. More important, we as the audience know who Batman is. We know that isn&rsquo;t what Batman does. He darts around, he uses the environment to his advantage. He fights smart. We have to know that he could just march forward and punch, and that would be enough, but that isn&rsquo;t Batman. Batman isn&rsquo;t strong, he&rsquo;s smart. That&rsquo;s the character.&nbsp;Now, we can wave this scene off. Maybe this was put in to establish that he isn&rsquo;t quite what he needs to be yet. He doesn&rsquo;t fight smart yet. Plausible. Except the police already have a bat signal set up, specifically to instill fear in exactly this sort of miscreant. So the scene is very at odds with everything the storytellers want us to think.Anyway, let's move on to the next scene. A crime scene. The Mayor has been murdered and Batman shows up to the crime scene to, we can only assume, help with the investigation. When he arrives, Detective Jim Gordon vouches for him and the phalanx of officers lining the hall let him pass. This is a good detail. It establishes a history and a sense of trust. The officers don&rsquo;t trust this masked vigilante, but a very senior detective does. That could only have happened if they had some history, if Batman had proven useful in previous investigations. This is the sort of welcome that you would expect from a Sherlock Holmes type character. A person who, while onerous, is extremely useful in exactly these circumstances. That&rsquo;s good. That&rsquo;s the Batman that we as an audience already know. The Batman that they need us to know for any of this to make sense.Then they have him sort of stand there, in the way, and Jim Gordon tells him everything. Absolutely wild. It&rsquo;s like whiffing a T-Ball. Had he walked in and immediately pointed out all the crime scene details the investigators were missing, put together the missing puzzle pieces, and basically did the job, it would have made sense to have him there. It would have made sense that Gordon vouched for him. He would have been acting like Batman. They had all the runway laid for this masked weirdo to be a superhero, and they just didn&rsquo;t. Very strange.Again, nothing else about the story would have to have changed for this to be added to the scene. The investigation would still go on because the riddler would still be ahead of them and the next plans were already in motion. But the character would be acting like the character. The one that they, as writers, need us to know before we started watching for any of this to work.&nbsp;Next we have another scene with Batman and Jim Gordon. They are searching an old orphanage for clues. It has been abandoned for some time, and junkies hooked on the trendy new drug are squatting there. The two investigators are walking through darkened hallways, Gordon with his gun at the ready, and Batman skulking behind in the shadows. Good. That&rsquo;s how these two men move through the world. That is their characters.Suddenly, out of the dark, a junky runs into the beam of Gordon&rsquo;s flashlight. That just sort of happens. He&rsquo;s startled, but nothing else comes of it. Again, we have the opportunity for Batman to show who he is. Gordon is the grizzled detective who might raise his gun, and he might even fire. Batman would be the man who would stop him. These are junkies, but they are innocent. They are the type of people that Batman would protect. Him simply grabbing the gun and pushing it down would be enough. This is the guy that reacts faster than everyone else, who thinks faster than everyone else. He is the scary thing in the hallway, not the junky. We know that because we know this character. When given the opportunity to prove it, the filmmakers simply let it pass.Again, we could be charitable. We could imagine that they intended this Batman to be young, unseasoned, early in his development. But that read falls flat. The film depends so much on the audience being familiar with this character and this world, that having him act counter to what we know is jarring. If this was a new superhero, if this was a new world, if this was a new story, by all means, write them any way you want. But it&rsquo;s not, and we know that, and they know that we know that.&nbsp;Those three scenes alone are enough to make me scratch my head, but, like I said before, I&rsquo;ll toss in one more.Near the end of the movie, the Riddler has amassed a reactionary army of disenfranchised and angry young men. Topical and mildly haunting to be sure. When Batman figures out the plot, he rushes off to intercept them before they can shoot a bunch of innocent people trapped in a building. There is an assumption made that there is no way one man, no matter how well-trained, well armored, or fanatical, in the pursuit of protecting people, could possibly stop all of these terrorists. It is assumed, but never voiced. Did it need to be voiced? Maybe not. Just running into danger with the intent to help is enough to prove that Batman is the hero in this situation. But there is also the assumption that he thinks he will win. There is an exchange omitted. Let me attempt to fill it in.Batman moves to leave, the room. He and a police officer have just figured out Riddlers plan to have terrorists attack hundreds of trapped and defenseless people.Cop - Where are you going? There are dozens of them. Even you can&rsquo;t fight that many. What do you think you are going to do.Batman - I&rsquo;m going to give them something else to shoot at.As the scene plays out, that is pretty much what happens. Batman acts as a distraction more than an actual assailing force. The terrorists are occupied long enough for people to start escaping, and for backup to arrive. The scene could be read that way, but it&rsquo;s important for it to be voiced, or at least presented unambiguously. Why? Because we already know this character, and acting selflessly is what he does. It is always what he does. And you absolutely need to drive that point home at every opportunity for this story to work. Maybe that line is a bit cheesy. That would not have been out of place in this movie.At no point did I expect a different story or tone than they delivered. The pacing could have been sped up significantly, but overall The Batman is competently made and assembled. It works. But for a movie that depends so heavily on the audience filling in blanks, they deviate from the main character that we already know quite well in strange and almost careless ways.Superheroes are, at their core, deeply goofy. Not much of it makes any real world sense. But they are archetypes. Characters that act and react in a steadfast way. They are always that character. They have to be. It comes with the genre. It&rsquo;s what people expect. Sometimes, meeting people&rsquo;s expectations is just as important to telling a story as subverting them. It&rsquo;s not always twists and character growth arcs. Sometimes these people just have to be who we already know they are. That&rsquo;s the bar. That&rsquo;s the assignment. Comic books understand that. We are getting to the point that most comic book based movies know that too. Apparently not all of them.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tSo, I have false teeth. I spent most of my life playing a lot of hockey, and I have found that pretty much everyone assumes it&rsquo;s due to that. Fair enough. If the sport is associated with anything, it might be missing teeth. Nothing so gruesome happened. Honestly, in all the games I have played, I think I have only been hit in the mouth with sticks a couple of times, and pucks never. Well, maybe only once. Or twice. Who keeps track of these things. Nope, it&rsquo;s the mundane genetic reason. I have hypodontia.&nbsp;Hypodontia, if you are not familiar, is naturally missing teeth. I am specifically missing the lateral incisors. It&rsquo;s so common that I have noticed it in a lot of other people. I have also noticed that most of them don&rsquo;t like other people pointing it out. Oh well.The long and short of it is that I have had false teeth since I was about fifteen. I try to take very good care of them, so I am only on my third set. This last set, they didn&rsquo;t last as well as others. Yep. I broke my teeth.Here&rsquo;s the other thing about me. I&rsquo;m that weirdo who will fix his own teeth. I&rsquo;m also that weirdo that has acquired all the skills necessary to fix his own teeth. Life casting with alginate and plaster. Done that. 3D modelling and printing to make my own dental impression tray. Can do. Working with acrylics and acrylic solvents. Literal years of experience. Handy with a dremel. Sure.I printed my own dental tray, got some alginate and plaster from one of those hobby hand impression kits from the dollar store (trust me, it&rsquo;s exactly the same stuff), and got some acrylic powder and solvent from denture repair kits (also, trust me, exactly the same stuff). I made a positive cast of my upper teeth and mouth and used that to align my denture and teeth.&nbsp;The first time I broke these teeth, I was able to put them back together, but I hadn&rsquo;t mastered getting the bite right.The second time they broke, I got them fitted really well, but the connections between the teeth and the plate were too thin. There was no way they were strong enough to last.This time, I put them all back together, but the original plate has been taken apart and put back together too many times. I know what happens to acrylic when you repeatedly apply solvents to it. I don&rsquo;t have a lot of confidence in it anymore. Also, I ran out of acrylic powder.Even though I am exactly that weirdo who will fix his own teeth, it&rsquo;s now time to call in the experts.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll go in and get a new set of teeth made. Hopefully they last for another ten years or so. If they don&rsquo;t, I suppose I could always fix them again.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Final Fantasy Tactics AdvanceThe resolution of the gameboy advance screen is 240 x 160. That isn&rsquo;t a lot of space. In the english version, a single font character is about six pixels tall by four pixels wide. That is extremely efficient for a font, but it also means that you can&rsquo;t put pages of text on the screen. There just isn&rsquo;t enough room for all of it. That&rsquo;s why the menu system for Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is amazing.I just finished looking at some old reviews of the game. Time capsule takes from the early 2000s. There were a lot of people praising the game, but the menu system was either not mentioned or maligned. I think a lot of people just didn&rsquo;t know what they had on their hands. Or, in their hands.Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is part of a long-ish series of strategy rpg game put out by Square. It is charming as hell, and mostly joyful. The art takes beautiful advantage of all 240x160 pixels of a Gameboy Advance screen. Subtle touches make the character designs and landscapes appear more detailed than they actually are.The story, though slow to get going, is interesting and nuanced for a game like this.&nbsp;The missions are fun and work like a multilayered puzzle, where you can sway the constraints and advantages in your favor even before your first attack.&nbsp;Strategy games like this live and die on their interfaces. There is usually a lot of complicated machinery and statistics that the player needs to be aware of at all times, and 240x160 pixels is just not enough room to display it all. Rather than attempting that, the devs of FFTA decided to tuck all the relevant menus and UI away under a few button clicks.I think this is what reviewers were complaining about. They would have rather had all information visible at all times. That would never have been possible on such a small screen. Instead, they made every relevant menu one click away.Now this might sound obvious, or simplistic. Every PC game has pop out menus. Most PC apps have pop out menus. They are context aware so that only the stuff you truly need at the moment is available. You would think that game menus would be exactly the same. Except they aren&rsquo;t, and back in 2003 on a handheld system, they super weren&rsquo;t. Menus would commonly be stored in subscreens where you had to press the start or select button first, and then navigate around to what you were looking for. Or you would press &lsquo;Attack&rsquo; and all of the relevant attack menus would become available.FFTA uses true, context aware menus. For everything. No feature of the game is more than two or three button presses away. And as soon as you get used to navigating it, you can just fly around those menus. And that is where the interactivity of a strategy game lives. A series of menus and button presses.&nbsp;Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is one of the best games, and it&rsquo;s not because of the story or the art or the music or even the complex but satisfying strategy. It&rsquo;s because they did menus so very, very well.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI started a story about two years ago. Best I can figure, anyway. The first date on the original document is April 11, 2020. I didn&rsquo;t really know what the story was going to be about when I started it. That&rsquo;s how it usually goes. I start with one image or idea and sort of figure it out from there. By the time I have a few pages typed up, I start to understand who the characters are and what they want. After that, I gradually walk my way to an ending.That story, All Legacy Hardware, is now published in the sci-fi and fantasy magazine, Cossmass Infinities - issue 8.Before it landed there, that story was all manner of things. Eventually it was whittled down and refined into what it is now. It had no title, and then a placeholder title, and then a different placeholder title for a bit. It was always about an athlete getting a spine replacement, but as soon as I added the sister character, the story became about two sisters. The order of the events changed. It was much longer, then only a little longer, then a tiny bit shorter, and finally the length that it is. Which, I will admit, might be slightly too long. Character names changed, events were rearranged. I did research and got the opinions of a lot of different folks. Some of them, former and current, professional writers, scientists, and athletes. I changed the story based on a lot of different feedback. Hopefully that made it better.&nbsp;Before it found its home at Cossmass Infinities, I sent it out to a few other places. They all rejected it. I used that time to go back over the story and punch it up in places where it was lacking. I even got some useful feedback from a couple of them, so that was nice. I still think there are some spots that I would like to change, where it isn&rsquo;t as good as it could be. But I know that when I started the story two years ago, that was the best I could do. Maybe I could write it better now, maybe not, but at the time, I tried to write the best story I could.In any case, All Legacy Hardware, is my first professional sale, and my first published story.In the two years between then and now, I have started, and finished, several more stories. Some of them, I have submitted to professional outlets for publishing. Most of them will probably get rejected, at least a few times. I think my writing has gotten better since I started that story, slightly more confident, a little more dexterous.&nbsp;These posts here, these are stream of conscious things. They aren&rsquo;t trying to be efficient or punchy. They will probably continue to be just as meandering and clunky as ever. But the stuff I take my time with and put some real work into, there are a few more of those floating around out there just waiting for a place to land. Hopefully one of them will eventually.If they do, I will be sure to mention it here.&nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - SyndicateSometimes, one of these best games isn&rsquo;t really a very good game. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just the promise of the game. The thing it could be. What people imagine it to be.&nbsp;I have played the first few missions of Syndicate many, many times. There are fifty missions in the game. I doubt if I have ever played more than twenty.As a game, Syndicate controls pretty poorly. You point and click where you want your agents to go. You point and click where you want your agents to shoot. You point and click what you want your agents to carry. If there is a thing to do in Syndicate, you probably point and click it. While this does seem like the simplest type of interface on any computer with a mouse, this game is too complex for a simple point and click. Syndicate wants you to do a lot in a short amount of time. It gets really cumbersome, really fast.Why then, have I played this game, or at least the start of this game, so many times over the years.Syndicate has amazing promise.It&rsquo;s for the same reason that people bring the game up with fond nostalgia in their voices. It&rsquo;s why the game shows up on a lot of classic games lists. It&rsquo;s why people have tried to make sequels or successors over the years, and it&rsquo;s why there is probably someone actively pitching for a new Syndicate right now.&nbsp;Nothing ever comes close. Nothing ever will. Not even Syndicate comes close to being Syndicate.The concept is the most jet black of dystopic fiction. The world is terrible. As an escape, the entire population is fitted with chips that distort reality for them just enough to not be constantly depressed. The sky is artificially just a little brighter. The earth just a little greener.&nbsp;Of course, the same chips that keep people happy and docile can be used to control them. Corporations turn ordinary citizens into cyborg agents and wage wars for territory and control. The Syndicate with the most brains under their control wins.Wins what exactly, we will never know. The world of the game is in a constant cycle of domination and control. The dominators change, but the world is stuck in an awful stasis.It is unapologetically bleak. More important, you are not the hero of this story. You are not a savior that will free everyone from the shackles of evil. You are the evil. You are in control of a squad of agents on missions to murder, kidnap, and coerce until the world bows to you.There is something very cathartic about that sort of fantasy. A perverse joy in being morally empty. It&rsquo;s a role that very few games let you play.&nbsp;Besides the setting, the world of the game is surprisingly dynamic. For a game from 1993, the world can occasionally feel alive. People and traffic follow their own patterns. Guards and police are usually quite stupid, but there are flashes of brilliance every once in a while.But, not enough.Syndicate is an almost game. It almost controls well enough. It almost breaks new ground for a an interactive, dynamic environment. It is almost fun enough to last for fifty levels. But it isn&rsquo;t.I think that is why it persists. Why people still remember this game. It&rsquo;s a game where you can imagine all the things it could have been, but no other game has ever come close to matching that. Syndicate has never matched that.It&rsquo;s so very close though.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s like that movie that would have been wonderful if only they had a slightly higher budget, or that book that almost hits, but there are two chapters too many and a major plot element is unresolved.Most games are either pretty good or pretty bad. There aren&rsquo;t many &lsquo;Almost&rsquo; games out there. Syndicate is one of them.Is Syndicate one of the best games? No, not really. But it points firmly in the direction of greatness. The direction that games like Grand Theft Auto, and X-COM would eventually go.I think that&rsquo;s why Syndicate still lives in the memories of so many people who played it. Something about the setting and the dynamic open world really dug into players thoughts and expectations.Syndicate might just be the best almost game.&#8203;\t\t"

That&rsquo;s right, like the Choose Your Own Adventure books. Except this isn&rsquo;t a choose your own adventure. This is a horror story.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t write a lot of horror stories. Over the last few years, I think that I have only written two. I started writing this one and nothing worked. It wasn&rsquo;t scary or unnerving. I think I am going for unnerving, really. Unnerving is my center. That&rsquo;s the pivot point for most of my stories. Even if the story is about something relatively mundane, I will always veer toward unnerving. Something fundamentally disquieting.I was writing this story, and none of it worked. The images were supposed to be grim and upsetting, but they just seemed camp and pseudo-scary. Like &lsquo;Spirit Halloween&rsquo; scary. Until I changed the perspective to second person.Second person can be a gimmick. I don&rsquo;t think it works for most stories. It works for games and game books, because, well, you are the one making the choices. For most stories, it doesn&rsquo;t really land. The use of &lsquo;You&rsquo; can be jarring. I think there are very few examples of it working.There are a few rules that will make second person work properly in fiction. First, the narrator voice must be a character in the story, and the person being narrated to can&rsquo;t be the reader. The reader knows who they are. The characters must be separate from them, and exist fully within the fiction of the story. There needs to be a little distance there.&nbsp;If you follow those rules though, second person can be very unnerving. And that works well for horror.I don&rsquo;t know if this story will be successful, but I&rsquo;m near finishing it. I guess I will find out when it&rsquo;s all done and submitted.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI haven&rsquo;t been playing the big, flashy, new Fromsoft game. I probably won&rsquo;t play it for a while.I mean, it seems great and all. I really do like their games. I think that they are tough, but not more so than old 8bit games. I will probably get around to the huge, open world spectacle that is Elden Ring, but right now I&rsquo;m still enjoying Sekiro. A more than two year old game that I only just got around to playing recently.I get to a lot of games late, but I have found that they are usually still pretty good by the time I play them. I think the same will probably be true of Elden Ring.&nbsp;Every time I play a Fromsoft game, I am always amazed by the things that they can get away with, things that probably wouldn&rsquo;t be tolerated from other developers, but I think I know why. Lets just break some of them down.The interfaces are usually terrible.&nbsp;Everything is heavily animation driven.Those animations don&rsquo;t have interrupts.They can be janky as hell.Signposting is usually pretty bad.Sometimes, they are ridiculously difficult.From the top, one of the main complaints levied against From games is that their interfaces are bad. And they are. Except that depends on what people are referring to as interface. Equipment menus and character stats screens in from games can be needlessly opaque or cluttered. You usually have more crap in your inventory than you know what to do with, and there is never a great way to organize it. The actual interface that you use to play the game, the camera controls, character controls, and buttons you need to press to get things done, those are great. The games feel great to play. There should be almost no reason for you to jump out to the inventory menu while you are playing. That&rsquo;s stuff you manage in the quiet times between fights.&nbsp;So, could those inventory menus be better? Of course. Should you be spending a lot of time in there rather than fighting or exploring? No. Do what you need to do in there, and get out. From just didn&rsquo;t put that much thought into the parts of the game you are not meant to be playing.The next two sort of go together. Things in From games, at least the recent set of them, are extremely animation driven. What do I mean by that? If you hit a button, your character will run through the same animation every time. The wind up, and the follow through, will always be the same length. They will take the same amount of time. Sure, most games do this, but the Souls series takes it to an extreme. There is often no way to cancel out of a move after it starts. You can&rsquo;t tap another button and interrupt your sword swing with a dodge or shield swing. If you hit those buttons, you better mean it, because there are no take backs.This goes extra for the enemies. Every enemy in a Souls game has a strict set of moves and times that they will launch them. The bad news is, even if you hit an enemy at the start of an attack, they will likely not stop or be interrupted if you slip a standard attack in before they hit you. They will just keep on rolling right over you. Those animations don&rsquo;t stop for nothin&rsquo; baby.&nbsp;While there is usually some sort of parry move that will deflect an attack, some stuff will just hit you no matter what you do. The only way to avoid being hit, is to just not be there.While that isn&rsquo;t very dynamic, it does mean that you can learn every single move and combo that an enemy has on tap. You can see them coming and respond accordingly. This is an extremely old-school way of designing fights, pulled right from the 8 and 16 bit era of games. It still works, so why not milk it for everything it&rsquo;s worth and put new graphical clothes on it.&nbsp;All of Fromsofts games have a slightly loose feeling. This is that jank I&rsquo;m talking about. And also the signposting. If you see a ledge, you can probably figure out some sort of combination of jumps and roll that will get you there. If you walk up to an edge, you will probably fall off of it. The pathway from one area to another might not always be obvious, and the architecture seems to have been built, ramshackle, one thing on top of another over centuries. It&rsquo;s all an accessibility and safety nightmare. You will never have any idea where to go, but you will usually be able to tell if you are somewhere new, because nothing looks the same from place to place.What it does do, is it gives you an unending torrent of tiny corners to explore and dead ends to examine and explore. The Souls worlds feel like they are filled with adventure and danger. Nowhere is safe, but everywhere is a new opportunity. Finding out what treasure, or horror, sits waiting around the next corner, is why people play these games. Sometimes things will just glitch through walls or floors, and that is part of the fun too. What sort of weirdness, intentional or otherwise, will this game offer up today.The last one is difficulty.The Souls games can be tough. Sometimes frustratingly so. They are also incredibly generous. More than most games.If you want to stop and catch your breath in any of these Fromsoft games, go right ahead. If you aren&rsquo;t actively in a fight, just put the controller down. The game will wait for you. There are rarely any wandering monsters, or at least not many that travel any distance from their arenas. If you want a fight, You are going to have to go looking for it.If you need to take a break, just stop right where you are. The games save all the time. If you don&rsquo;t restart right where you were standing, you will only be a few seconds away.When you engage with the game, it can be demanding, but the how and where you do that, is entirely up to you. You only need to focus on your terms.&nbsp;Boss fights in any From game usually get my heart going, but the parts in between can be quite relaxing.&nbsp;So why does From get away with making opaque, difficult games with terrible menus, when every other game maker would get roasted for doing the same. It&rsquo;s because they get the core extremely right. They make interesting adventure games that feel like adventures. They make difficult games that let you chill out and wait for you to be ready before presenting a challenge. The menus that don&rsquo;t really matter are sort of clunky, while the parts you actually interact with on a regular basis are extremely polished. Enemies will ignore your hits and throw unblockable attacks at you, but they are always the same so you can learn them and learn to exploit them. And most of the time, you can exploit the hell out of them. Seeing what cheesy nonsense you can get away with in a souls game is a lot of the fun.&nbsp;Fromsoft gets away with all of this, because they make good, videogame-ass video games.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI have been writing a story, in bits and pieces, for the last two weeks or so. Earlier this week, I had started working on this post. I was going to write about how I took a very meandering route. How I had started the story from one characters perspective, and then changed it to be from another, and then changed it again to be from the perspective of an omniscient narrator, and how none of that was working. How I eventually changed it to a less conventional, but much more appropriate perspective.&nbsp;None of that seems to matter very much at the moment.There are more important things going on in the world.The problem is, I don&rsquo;t know how to write about them. I don&rsquo;t know what words to use. I don&rsquo;t know what order to put them in. I don&rsquo;t know how to frame thoughtless tragedies and horrific, evil acts.I know how to write stories. I know how to rework them so that they function. I know how to voice identifiable characters. At least, I think I do.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know how to write about any of this. I don&rsquo;t know how to form my rage and despair into words that would be helpful to anyone.I know how to write stories. I know how to write about games. Or movies. Or music. Or art. Or 3D animation software.They are simple, silly, trivial things.Maybe reading some of those things will bring someone some small amount of joy.I believe I will keep writing about those things.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know how to write about what&rsquo;s going on. That&rsquo;s no reason to stop writing.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Mass Effect (1, 2, and 3)Games are games and movies are movie and books are books. They all work themselves into you. They all occupy different pockets of memory. Just like a song will bring me back to some specific moment, recalling a passage in a book or a sequence in a movie will set my feet in the past. Games are usually a little different, though.Games aren&rsquo;t a moment in time. A snapshot. Games are an era.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s partially about time. Games take a lot longer than a movie or a handful of pages to do their work. The emotional impact that etches itself into your memory takes a little longer. Occasionally, a lot longer.I can only really compare Mass Effect to Star Trek. And it&rsquo;s not for the obvious reasons. The apparent ones. That both are space faring adventures, or that both have a rich fictional history with memorable personalities from a variety of alien races. No, it&rsquo;s not that. They are similar in the way that they burrowed their way into me. Slowly. Bit by bit. Scene by scene. Idea by idea.There is no single scene that I can point to, and say &lsquo;there, that&rsquo;s Mass Effect&rsquo;. There is no single combat encounter. There is no dialog sequence or character interaction. Mass Effect is the entire trilogy. All of its triumphs and fumbles. All of its strengths and failings.I know things about Turian and Quarian Biology that will never help me in life. I can tell you the difference between a Salarian and Krogan and the complicated history of their people. This isn&rsquo;t the sort of information that you casually accumulate. This is the sort of thing that you need to seek out. It needs to be reinforced over hours and hours of play time. You need to want to know this stuff. And I did. Still do.With the singular exception of Metal Gear, I don&rsquo;t think that any game series has the depth and detail that is woven into Mass Effect. None of them have spent the time. None are as cohesive. I could be wrong. I would be happy to be wrong. But I have played a lot of games. Frankly, nothing I&rsquo;ve seen comes close.Star Trek had many decades, hundreds of hours, three full, human, generations to develop its lore. Mass Effect did something similar in about a hundred hours over five years. Impressive, really, when you think about it.I could attempt to list of great moments or characters in Mass Effect, but that&rsquo;s not how they are structured in my memory. It isn&rsquo;t moments. It isn&rsquo;t single images. There was a time when I thought a lot about Mass Effect. An era. It is a game series tied to a time in my life. I suspect it&rsquo;s similar for a lot of other people who played it. People who know, will know. For everyone else, I think I can only offer, You should play Mass Effect.It&rsquo;s one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI would rather be writing something else.I have a handful of unfinished shorts stories and a couple of finished ones that need edits. I would rather be writing those, but this is what I&rsquo;m writing right now.That doesn&rsquo;t seem like an important detail. Like, so what. People work on the thing they don&rsquo;t want to work on all the time. Maybe most of the time. That isn&rsquo;t the point I&rsquo;m driving toward. That&rsquo;s a bigger problem, and one that I certainly won&rsquo;t be able to tackle in a few hundred words. What I am going to attempt to touch on, is writers block. Or the illusion of writers block. Or dealing with it when it happens.So, I will state up front here that I don&rsquo;t think writers block is a real thing. Like, there is no point where you simply can&rsquo;t get words out of the tips of your fingers, or whatever. The term &lsquo;writers block&rsquo; is an inelegant blanket that covers a lot of subtler, but potentially more addressable, issues. I never have writers block. I have spent a lot of time not writing the thing I want to write, and I have spent a lot of time not advancing my writing. Sometimes the right words are just tough to dig up.I think there are a lot of reasons that people aren&rsquo;t able to write. Most of them come down to either expectations, or writing the wrong thing. Sometimes those are the same.So, what am I talking about here. Well, first you have expectations. Everyone, and I do mean everyone, wants to write perfectly the first time. Every person who has ever written anything&nbsp;knows that the best work comes out of&nbsp;editing, maybe many rounds of editing.&nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. Everyone wants to write the absolute perfect words in the absolute perfect order the first time. Suppressing the voice in your head that tells you this time it will be different, this time you will write perfectly the first time, takes practice. And time. And even then it won&rsquo;t work. You will always hope you can write perfectly the first time. It will never, ever happen. Getting used to that is a huge step in the direction of living without &lsquo;writers block&rsquo;. Knowing that you will have more than one chance to get it right, that getting it right will take many rounds of editing, gives you the freedom to write poorly. Or well. It gives you the freedom to just write and figure it out later.The second problem is sort of related to the first. Sometimes people just write the wrong thing. Not the wrong words, not the wrong content. Sometimes people feel like they have to write the part that they don&rsquo;t want to deal with. The busy-work of writing. The &lsquo;get you from here to there&rsquo; scenes or sections. This is usually because you got bogged down in the &lsquo;Writing it properly the first time&rsquo; trap. You have started to think that there are parts you must write, even though they don&rsquo;t interest you. There is an incredibly simple solution to this problem.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t write that. Move on to a scene you want to write. Something interesting. Something exciting, or frightening, or powerful, or inspiring. Any of the things that you really want to write. Sticking all of those good parts together is a problem for &lsquo;editing&rsquo; you. And &lsquo;editing&rsquo; you will have a way easier time of it if all the scenes are exciting or interesting. They will be fun to edit, and they probably require less &lsquo;non-interesting&rsquo; bridge material than you originally thought.&nbsp;As long as you make everything you write a problem for a future version of you to deal with (this includes edits) you will eventually find that there is one version of you that has nothing left to do. That&rsquo;s how you know you are done writing, and you never had to suffer through &lsquo;writers block&rsquo; to get there. You only had to do the fun and exciting parts over and over and over again.&nbsp;Everything will take way longer than you expect and most part of the process will be hard work, but none of it needs to be so terrible that you find yourself unable to write at all.&nbsp;I would much rather have been writing a lot of other things, but I went and wrote all this by breaking it down into parts that I liked and worked my way though it in chunks.Is it great. No. could it use edits. Of course. But I did write it. First word to last.You can too.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI&rsquo;m watching women&rsquo;s Olympic Hockey as I write this. Earlier today, I watched Slopestyle snowboarding. Before that, we watched some Super-G skiing, and some Big Air Skiing.&nbsp;I like sports. I know a lot of people don&rsquo;t, even a lot of people who like games. I think maybe they should try watching the Olympics.It&rsquo;s the variety. There are just so many different types of competitions and events. All of them have their own rules and goals. Some have judging systems and points. There are so many systems and variables at work. I know that is true of all sports, but rather than having to go deep on one sport, knowing all the players, all the history, each Olympic sport will come with a lot of explanation from the commentators. No one expects the casual viewer to be acquainted with the specific degree of difficulty for a triple Salchow jump. I have been watching figure skating for years, I even used to compete in figure skating, and I could not tell you what, specifically, makes an Axel more difficult than a Salchow. Or why everyone pronounces it SowCow. That&rsquo;s fine though. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. As a viewer, you get to enjoy an incredible variety of sports being played at the highest level for a couple of weeks. And if you are a game designer, I think you absolutely have to watch the Olympics.Maybe physical competition isn&rsquo;t your thing. You are more of a strategy designer. Watch Curling. The nearly infinite possibility space of a game played with a few heavy pieces of granite and a giant bullseye is staggering. Maybe you like something with some team co-operation where unique roles complement each other. Watch Hockey. A team of players cycling a penalty kill effectively is beautiful, once you figure out what you are looking at. Here&rsquo;s a tip. The players on the ice are rarely looking at the puck. There is no reason for you to look at the puck, either. Watch where the players go. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s important.If you like displays of individual skill, the Winter Olympics have you covered. Any sort of ski or snowboard jumping, spinning, or flipping you can imagine. The judging of these events can be a little arcane, but it will be impressive nonetheless. And last, but not least, If you are looking for simple competitive drama, Speed Skating or snowboard cross has got you covered.&nbsp;There aren&rsquo;t many styles of games that aren&rsquo;t covered by the Olympics. If you rope in the Summer Olympics, you also have a lot of combat sports to enjoy. Snowball fighting has not yet been declared an Olympic sport.So, right now,&nbsp; the Canadian Women are dominating this game. It&rsquo;s pretty much a lock. Of course, they will be playing the Americans tomorrow, so that will be more of a nail biter. I&rsquo;ll probably be watching.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Puzz Loop / ZumaThis is a tough one. I think Zuma is one of the best games of all time, but its core concept is also lifted from another game, Puzz Loop.The problem I have, is that Puzz Loop is good, but not great. Zuma is great, but not original. So who do you give the honors to.First, let me describe what we are working with here. Zuma, like Puzz Loop, is an action puzzle game. Think Tetris or Bejeweled. Three in a row, color matching mechanics, but with a ticking clock. You are trying to combine three orbs of the same color. Simple enough right? A snake of different colored balls travels along a set path. In the case of Puzz Loop, a spiral. In the case of Zuma, a slightly wiggly spiral that sometimes crosses over or under itself. In both, you operate a device in the center of the spiral that spits out different colored balls. You fire the balls out, lodge them in between segments of the snake, and, if you did it right, you match three of a kind, and they blow up. There are lots of little powerups and mechanics that add to that, but really that&rsquo;s the core of both of these games. Shoot balls at other balls to make them go away before they reach the center. When they reach the center, the game is over.Puzz Loop could have been a great game. It had all the features of a great game. Fairly simple to learn, high skill cap, lots of ways to approach the same situation. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s good, but not great.Zuma took the concept and ran with it.At the most basic level, just changing the path that the snake of orbs travels down is pretty profound. Both Zuma and Puzz Loop incorporate a travel time into their ball firing mechanic. When you shoot, it will take a moment for that shot to get to where you are aiming. This means that you will, however slightly, have to lead your targets. The further away they are, the more you will have to predict the path your shots will take. As soon as the snake starts to take a curvy, non-uniform, path, the skill requirement on your shots goes up. You are rewarded for playing better.There are other, surface level, things that make Zuma better, like better graphics and sound. Those aren&rsquo;t strictly tied to the quality of the game, but they are nice to have.The real kicker is platform. Puzz Loop is an arcade game, and it lives in a standard arcade cabinet. The default control scheme for arcade machines are the venerable stick and buttons. While it works fine, Puzz Loop on a stick and buttons just can&rsquo;t compare to Zuma using a mouse. The speed and accuracy of mouse control is tough to beat. It&rsquo;s like going from a working concept to a full-fledged production model. Zuma is just a better game.So what do you do when one developer lifts the ideas of another developer, but rather than creating a crass clone, actually enhances the core gameplay. It happens all the time in other genres. For a long time, first-person shooters were called Doom clones. RTS games were referred to in publications as &lsquo;like Warcraft&rsquo; even though warcraft was like Dune II and Dune II was sort of like Herzog Zwai. Developers taking inspiration from a game and then pushing that ball further down the field is sort of how things have always been done.&nbsp;Puzz Loop is en extremely simple game. The core mechanics can be intuited from a single image. It&rsquo;s a good concept, but someone had to push that ball further down the field. There is a Puzz Loop 2. That game doesn&rsquo;t advance the concept. Zuma does.&nbsp;So, Zuma might be one of the best games, but Puzz Loop is one of the best game concepts. When offered the choice, I would pick Zuma every time.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tQuite a few years ago, I decided to write something and post it up here at least once a week. So every week for at least four hundred and eighty-two weeks, I wrote (and occasionally drew or painted) something and posted it. At first, none of it was fiction. I didn&rsquo;t know how to write fiction.Then, slightly fewer years ago, I decided to write fiction. I&rsquo;m not really sure why. I had an idea for a story, so that&rsquo;s what I wrote. I wrote something short, because I thought that would be easier than writing something long. In one way, I suppose that is true. Since there are fewer words, you can look it over and see all the things that you want to change and wish you had written better in a shorter span of time. In that way, it&rsquo;s easier. In another, much more real way, shorter stories aren&rsquo;t easy at all.&nbsp;By now, I have written somewhere around twenty short stories. And a few much longer ones. Most of them are finished. A few of them I am still working on. One of the unfinished ones is about a third of a book. In a lot of ways, writing that one is a lot easier than the short ones. In a longer story, you have more room to breath. You don&rsquo;t need to be as precise. The words don&rsquo;t need to be as densely packed.In all this time, for whatever stupid reason, I haven&rsquo;t been reading short stories. I have been reading novels, but I read fairly slowly, so I don&rsquo;t plow through dense tomes or epic series. It didn&rsquo;t occur to me that I could read short stories.&nbsp;As soon as I decided to try to sell a few short stories, I figured I should read some.&nbsp;Surprise, surprise, short stories are freakin great. They can get weird in ways that a novel rarely could. Exploring single topics fully without getting bogged down in too much extraneous drama. They usually take less than an hour or so to read, and if one of them doesn&rsquo;t fully hit, you can probably move on to the next pretty easily.&nbsp;I realize that it seems obvious and idiotic, that if I was going to write short stories, I should also read them, but what can I tell you, It honestly didn&rsquo;t occur to me.&nbsp;Also, it seems, the world of sci-if shorts, at the very least, is extremely punk. In all the good ways. In all the counterculture and nonconformist ways that you want good writing to be. That&rsquo;s probably not me, since I am a pretty bland white guy, but I sure do like to read it.&nbsp;If what I have been reading is any indication, the future of genre writing is a lot less bland and white. I&rsquo;m 100% here for it. If I can slip one or two of my semi-optimistic adventures in there with all the punks, I will be grateful.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

I had worked on one story every day for a month and I needed a bit of distance from it before I came back to assess where to go from there.I&rsquo;m not super precious with my words, and I won&rsquo;t hesitate to throw away and rework large chunks of text, if I think it will make the story better. Still, sometimes I think I need some time away from a bit of writing before I can really look at it and figure out what I can do to improve it.Not what&rsquo;s wrong. Imagining that something is &lsquo;wrong&rsquo; with a piece of writing supposes that there is some way to make it right. I don&rsquo;t think there is. I think there are ways to strengthen and improve a bit of writing. I think that you can make something better by reworking it, or rewriting it. But that isn&rsquo;t a destructive act. You aren&rsquo;t taking out what is broken and replacing it with something you fixed. You are refining a sketch.Right now I have a bit over 50000 words of sketch. Some of the lines are very clear and I can just leave them as they are. Others wander all over the page and don&rsquo;t really connect up to anything. The forms are undefined and the contrast between forms isn&rsquo;t as strong as it needs to be.&nbsp;I won&rsquo;t use any color metaphors, since I&rsquo;m no good at color in painting either.&nbsp;In drawing terms, right now I have a line of action and some ill defined shapes. I have built up the faith in myself that if I were at this stage of a drawing, I could probably finish it. I don&rsquo;t really have that with writing yet. I think I will get the story to where it needs to be, but I needed to take a few weeks away to regroup and refocus.&nbsp;Now that I am back, looking at it again, I think the base sketch might be alright. I&rsquo;ll keep working on it.&nbsp; &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Aliens TC Doom ModI realize this isn&rsquo;t a game.&nbsp;No. I&rsquo;m not going to go that far. It is a game. It is a fully formed game. Not a wholly original work, but that&rsquo;s not important, is it?.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a mod. A mod of Doom.The Aliens TC (total conversion) Doom Mod uses all the built-in content of Doom, controls, gameplay, a fair bit of the graphics and sounds, but it also adds a lot of its own additions.There is no doubt that the movie Aliens had a massive impact on game development in the early 90s. Games where you battle against unstoppable hordes of monsters were nothing new, but the thrill ride mentality of Aliens was an easy bleed over to the newly minted genre of first person games. Doom already had a lot of Aliens in its DNA.Licensed games in the early 90s were a bit of a crap shoot. Most of the ones made during that time were cross marketing tie-ins with little or no intrinsic value. There is a tragically large library of 8 and 16 bit licensed games that are absolute junk.Making a game built on the Doom engine that follows the events of Aliens, seems like it would be a no-brainer. Space marine walks down darkened hallways shooting monsters. It&rsquo;s surprising there wasn&rsquo;t ten of them. Of course, due to the track record of movie tie-in games,&nbsp; they would probably have been awful.&nbsp;So what&rsquo;s to be done about it then. If you&rsquo;re Justin Fisher, you pick up the Doom modding tools and do it yourself.Aliens TC includes a full campaign of custom levels, sounds and graphics ripped from the movie, and reskinned and tuned weapons made to resemble the ones in the film. There had been game mods before Aliens TC, but none of them took the base of a game and built an entirely new one on top of it. There are games like Heretic, where Raven software took the Doom engine and built something else entirely out of it, but that was an effort on the scale that a single person could never have accomplished it. For the most part, the Aliens TC was made by one guy.It was a good mod, and that is great and all, but why is Aliens TC important at all in the history of video games? Mods don&rsquo;t typically deserve much mention in the history of the medium.Aliens TC wasn&rsquo;t just good. It was a fundamental shift in the way people thought about games. This was a massive effort, but one that could be accomplished by a single person. The tools that the original game developers used were available, and sometimes they shipped on the disc with the game. The separation of engine and game had just hit a pivot point, and one guy decided to take advantage of it.For anyone that thought about getting into game development, there was before Aliens TC, when you needed a comp-sci degree or 10000 hours of bedroom coding on an 8bit computer, and there was after Aliens TC, when anyone sufficiently dedicated to the task could learn some tools and make a mod.Even if you had no interest in making games, Aliens TC was an extremely fun way to play a game you already owned all over again. Only this time you get to shoot xenomorphs.Aliens TC for Doom is one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI&rsquo;m almost done editing up one story, and I have another that is about fifty percent done. I don&rsquo;t know if they will find homes anywhere, but I think at least one of them is pretty &lsquo;marketable&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s short, concise, but presents a sense of place and time that is the sort of thing people look for in short stories. At least it&rsquo;s the sort of thing that I look for, and last I checked, I was people.&nbsp;That was all last year stuff. My goal for this year is one short story a month and finish the 70k or so words left in the book I&rsquo;m writing. I&rsquo;m much too far into it to stop now.&nbsp;I think one short story a month is a pretty good pace for me. If I was writing all the time, I think I would go faster, but that seems like a totally workable pace.&nbsp;I definitely have no lack of ideas. I have about twenty short story ideas in a document here, and that&rsquo;s only the ones I already committed to digital paper. I probably have a notion for one or two new ones every week. Now, most of them suck, but there are a lot of ideas.I have mostly focused on sci-fi stories and speculative fiction stories, because that is the sort of thing I like. I think I might branch out a bit though. I also like some other genre fiction. Some horror or fantasy. Mostly, I will continue my trend of writing characters that are, by a lot of people&rsquo;s interpretation, bland. They will be mostly kind or nice, and if they are &lsquo;the bad guy&rsquo; they will have to have a good and valid (to themselves) reason for it. There will be no moustache twirlers, dark lords, or Darth Sidious&rsquo;s on my watch. I find those characters dull beyond reckoning. They are not the opposite of a moral protagonist. The opposite would be someone who chooses a malicious path because they can somehow justify the ends. That might be bland or not larger than life, but I will like them. Since I&rsquo;m the one writing them, that&rsquo;s what they will be.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI finished a game this week. I was glad to have played it, but I was sad to have finished it.&nbsp;The DLC for the original Outer Wilds, Echoes of the Eye. It&rsquo;s a DLC that is so substantial that it&rsquo;s almost an&nbsp; entire game on its own.This is a feeling that I never get from movies, very rarely get from TV series, and occasionally get from books. Games, though, I get it a lot from games.&nbsp;I think it&rsquo;s a factor of time spent and thoughts devoted. A really good book, with a story that hooks me, will have me thinking about it for days or weeks. It is the rare TV series that will make me think about it for a while after I&rsquo;m done watching it. Games are experiences that you have to exist in. There are areas of the first Dark Souls that I know as well as streets of my home town. I expect they will echo back to me for years or even decades to come.&nbsp;Outer Wilds is the sort of game that makes me wish I could experience it again for the first time.When you finish this DLC, a story that is woven into the original so deftly that it could easily be part of the original play through, you have the option of stopping there or going back and completing the original game with the new knowledge you have acquired. I chose the second one.&nbsp;It had been a while since I had finished the main game, so rather than puzzle out what I had to do again, I looked up a walkthrough. Outer Wilds is a game that you can finish in a matter of minutes once you know what to do, so I belted off and started getting things done. Turns out I probably didn&rsquo;t need the walkthrough. As soon as I started completing tasks, it was like rapid fire nostalgia. I remembered everything and nailed every step. The story of that journey is part of me now. Just like the stories of Star Wars, or hundreds of episodes of Star Trek, Outer Wilds is embedded in my memory. Not because I watched it so many times, but because I experienced it. Games can do that. They create a different sort of memory. That&rsquo;s why you feel it more when they are over. It&rsquo;s not like a movie, with a two-hour runtime, or a book with a set number of pages. A lot of games are experiences you live in for as long as you want to keep going. And when you end them, it&rsquo;s because you choose to end them. I didn&rsquo;t want my time in Outer Wilds to be over, but I knew that I had seen all that it offered, and it was time to let it go. It didn&rsquo;t end, I decided that it was time to stop playing. To stop existing in that world.&nbsp;As far as storytelling mediums go, I think that is unique to games. The player chooses when they are over.&nbsp;I was felt sad to finish Echoes of the Eye, but I am immensely glad that I played it. If you haven&rsquo;t played Outer Wilds, you absolutely should. Just don&rsquo;t blame me for your lingering ennui and melancholy. That&rsquo;s just part of the experience.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - NHL 96I don&rsquo;t play a lot of sports games. I have definitely dabbled. The odd baseball or football game. Maybe a basketball game or two. Many car racing games. I have always preferred video games that were fantasies. Things I could never do in real life. I have a ball glove and a baseball. I don&rsquo;t have a rocket pack or a sword. Even if I did, I wouldn&rsquo;t&nbsp; be able to use it. Playing a game of catch wouldn&rsquo;t get anyone to look twice, but I really couldn&rsquo;t walk down my back path with a katana.&nbsp;The real world sport that I have played more than any other is hockey. I have only spent a few years of my life not playing hockey. Those were the first few and the most recent few. For the first few, I couldn&rsquo;t skate, and for the last few, well, no one could.&nbsp;There are a lot of sports game that are not simulations. They are arcade style games with a loose sports attachment. A sort of vestigial draw that people can recognize. Games like NBA Jam or NFL Blitz. They don&rsquo;t really have a lot to do with the sports they are based on. Something like 90% of all car racing games are not really about the sport of racing.This tends to work out in the game's favour. The closer a game hews to actual simulation, the more likely it is to come up short. There are simply not enough buttons on a controller, not a granular enough interface available, to describe the intricacies of most sports. You can pretend to Quarterback the Dallas Cowboys, but you can&rsquo;t simulate throwing a perfect thirty yard spiral with a game pad. Not really.There is no way to properly simulate playing hockey in a video game. No VR system will ever have the fidelity to incorporate the full body experience of skating, slapping a one timer, or executing a poke check.Still, I know what hockey is supposed to feel like. How the game is supposed to move and flow. NHL 96 (on PC, and even somewhat on consoles) was a massive leap above every video game representation of hockey before it. NHL 96 took the momentum and agility of moving on ice, and actually did a pretty good job of representing it. AI players made an attempt at playing their positions. The puck slid and bounced in ways that approximate realistic.A lot of simplifications were made to keep the game fun and accessible, but, for someone who had, up to that point, played a lot of hockey, the game felt like hockey. Up until that point, I had never played a game that felt anything like a real sport.Is it perfect? Of course not. Are any of the subsequent versions of the game perfect? Also, a big nope. They never will be, and that&rsquo;s okay. Sometimes you want the feel of hockey without going to the rink and lacing up your skates. The developers of NHL 96 seemed to feel the same way. This is not an arcade game that looks sort of like hockey, it&rsquo;s the feeling of hockey in a simplified form.It probably won&rsquo;t go down as the best sports game. Hockey games will never match the popularity of soccer, football, or basketball games. None of them will ever have the universal appeal of racing games. For one, brief shining moment, there was a sports game that aimed to simulate what the game felt like, and that deserves some recognition.&nbsp;NHL 96 is one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tSo I did it. I wrote a little over 50000 words in one month. Here is the postmortem.I guess I&rsquo;ll answer the two main questions that I had going in.The first question I had was simple. Could I do it? And if I could, how hard would it be?So the answer to the first was obviously, yes. I wrote around 1700 words every single day for 30 days. Some days I wrote slightly less, some days slightly more. There was one day that I wrote 3000. So the answer to the first question was, yep. I absolutely can write 50000 words in a month.The second question is a little more difficult. Was it hard? Well, yes and no. Simply typing 2000 or even 3000 words in a day, or really in a few hours, isn&rsquo;t that hard. Making up 1700 words of new story every day is a little more difficult. The main problem was that I didn&rsquo;t have a super clear idea where the story was going sometimes, and I sort of had to make it up on the fly. Usually I would make some sort of plan for what I was going to write the next day and then try as hard as I could to follow that plan. Sometimes it went off the rails and I would have to backtrack to fix it.The next things that I think people would want to know about taking on a challenge like this is, does it make you faster at writing? Does it make you a better writer?To answer the first question, for me at least, it didn&rsquo;t make me a faster writer. It took me anywhere from two to four hours every day to finish those words. Without fail. I never got faster. While I can type relatively quickly, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a very fast writer. I make mistakes and I backtrack, and I have trouble finding the exact words I want sometimes.&nbsp;I did notice that my writing got much more intricate as I went on. I started to take a wider view while still working on the sentence to sentence beats of a scene. I started to plan setups and reveals that would be pages or chapters away. While I don&rsquo;t think that what I wrote is very good yet, it needs a lot of editing and scene changes to make the characters consistent and more fully featured. I started to work on the long arcs of the plot. I set up mysteries that I know how to pay off later (and some that I don&rsquo;t yet). So far, for as thin as it is, the story functions. It does the things it needs to do to make a reader turn the page. It will take a lot of work to finish it, but it&rsquo;s on its way.Would I do it again? I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe. It is a good way to kick-start a book. And it shows you how much work writing a whole book might be. I suppose you could write a novella in that time, but I scoped a story that will take between one hundred thousand and one hundred twenty thousand to tell. I only really got close to the middle of the book.I think if I did it again, I would come with more planning. I had a short story and a handful of notes, but no real plan, so I had to make it up as I went. While that can work well, I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it as a method of creating very polished writing. What I have right now points me in a direction, but there is no way I could sell it. It&rsquo;s just too messy.What all of this did prove to me was, if you worked full time as a writer, you could write at least a book a year by typing up around 2000 words a day. It would take a few hours, and then you would have to spend the rest of the day fixing those words to make them something someone would want to read. It would be a full time job, but not an easy one.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

A modern fantasy, semi-romantic comedy, with some darker real world themes. Mostly though, it's an adventure story. It's meant to be fun. So far I think it is.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tFor the past week I have been doing NaNoWriMo. In that time I have written a little over 12000 words. The challenge is to reach 50000 by the end of the month. As long as I don&rsquo;t suddenly lose my fingers or suffer some sort of mental paralysis, it looks like I am on track to hit that target. After day one, I wasn&rsquo;t very hopeful.On that first day, every spare moment I had I would try to write. I would try and no words would come out. I would write ten or so words and then flounder around trying to follow that up. I&rsquo;ve written stories before. It&rsquo;s not like I don&rsquo;t know how to type the words out.I even had a plan. It was a pretty loose plan, but I had one. I knew that I wanted a cold open. You know when you watch a TV show and this batch of characters kick off the episode and not one of them is in the usual cast. You&rsquo;re watching along and this big dramatic event happens but you&rsquo;re not sure why you should care, because, like I said, none of these characters are the main cast of the show. Well what if the same thing happened, but you don&rsquo;t know who the main cast is so you follow along with these characters and something exciting happens and &lsquo;woosh&rsquo; you are off to some other story that is as completely divorced from what just happened as it could possibly be. And the show goes for a while and you think, &ldquo;oh. These are the main characters. So what was all that about?&rdquo;That. That is what I wanted to do with my opening chapter. So I had the plan. I even knew what would happen to the characters from the cold open. I know why it will be important later. Didn&rsquo;t matter. I just could not get the words to come out.I just barely made my word count that first day. The second day was the same. The third, a little better. By day five I was able to get into a flow and type most of the 1667 required words in one go. Today I did nearly 2000 words in about two and a half hours. There really is something to this whole, getting into a rhythm thing.&nbsp;I have no idea how the next weeks will go. Hopefully I can keep the pace up and not feel the stress of not hitting my word count every day. Lots of time left for the whole endeavor to go good or bad.&nbsp;Either way, I probably have some limited number of keycaps my fingers can tap in a day before wearing down to boney nubs, so I&rsquo;m going to keep these posts shorter for the next few weeks.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games -&nbsp; Mortal KombatMortal Kombat is a bait and switch.I have talked about Mortal Kombat here a lot. I bring it up when referencing other fighting games. I mention it in passing when talking about controls or graphics or violence. Mortal Kombat is probably my second favourite fighting game series, second to Street Fighter. I love a round or three of Tekken or Samurai Shodown or Fatal Fury or Soulcalibur or Dark Stalkers or&hellip; you get it. I like fighting games. Mortal Kombat sits near the top of that list. I think I got into it for the same reasons that most people did, for the same reasons that most people think you would get into Mortal Kombat, but I keep playing games in the series for the same reasons that other fighting game fans do.Mortal Kombat is the absolute picture perfect example of the bait and switch done right.&nbsp;Digitized photos and animation of actual humans in costumes was the first dangling of bait. When MK1 came out in arcades, seeing realistic images of people on video game screens had only been done a few times and it never made for good games. It was, undoubtedly, a gimmick, but a rare enough one that the game could draw a crowd.The characters could bleed. Not super uncommon in arcades at the time, but rare enough to be bait. Watching blood fly off of digital characters was novel enough that it caused a buzz.If you won, you could kill your opponent in flashy and gory ways. The last piece of bait. The cherry on top. Any fighting game player, hell any arcade goer at the time had to at least see what Mortal Kombat was all about.&nbsp;All gimmicks. All flash. Not the sort of thing that would land you on the Best Games list.&nbsp;When that wears off, what are you left with. As it turns out, an extremely solid fighting game.&nbsp;Mortal Kombat is a slower, harder hitting fighting game. Where Street Fighter 2 is a sort of high speed dance of feints and counters, Mortal Kombat is all marching forward and trading blows. Mortal Kombat is meatier. Heavier. When hits land, you feel them. If Street Fighter is like a kung fu movie, Mortal Kombat is like Rocky. Jumping in is not something you do without significant risk.&nbsp;There is something about the pace of a Mortal Kombat fight that I really like. It can be over in an instant, but you will be aware of all of the times you messed up. Mashing buttons won&rsquo;t help you. Range and timing matter more than speed. Special moves aren&rsquo;t difficult to execute but they follow a slightly more aggressive pattern than most fighting games. Lots of double taps and quick back and forth movements of the stick versus Street Fighters lean toward smooth half and quarter circles and charge moves.&nbsp;It would be pretty easy to argue, and I would probably agree, that the series didn&rsquo;t really get going until Mortal Kombat II. The second game was more fluid, faster, more dynamic, but it still hit as hard and still felt stiff in a very good way. A drop kick to the face has weight and impact and stops the fight for a second while both combatants (Kombatants?) recover. It makes space for the players to respond with a block, counter, or follow up. It&rsquo;s not uncommon to see a moment in a game of Mortal Kombat where both players just stop and stand perfectly still for a few frames. This hold or rest or break in the action is exactly what the game needs. It makes the next punch feel that much heavier, that much more damaging.When you take away the bait, the digitized actors, the blood, the finishing moves, you are left with a fighting game with a slightly different rhythm. Something that feels like the more vicious martial arts movies the developers were trying to emulate. Something with some heft.&nbsp;Both the Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat series are still going. They are both very good. They feel incredibly different to play.&nbsp;Mortal Kombat is one of the best games.&nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tSo this past week I sold a story. It&rsquo;s pretty exciting.I&rsquo;m going to do something here that I haven&rsquo;t done in over 450 posts. I&rsquo;m going to &lsquo;reprint&rsquo; an old post from 2014. You see, there is a reason that I wanted to publish a story. It&rsquo;s the same reason that I started writing it. It&rsquo;s the same reason that I wrote any of the stories I have. It's why I will keep writing.Thanks again Grandma.I remember leaning up against the stair railing in my grandmas house. She was watching Star Trek First Contact for the first time. I had seen it twice in the theatre and at least one more time when it came out on video, so I had it pretty much committed to memory. I was just passing through the house on my way somewhere, but I had stopped to watch the end of the movie with her. It would be more accurate to say that I stopped to watch her watching the movie. She was sitting intently, forward in her seat. She finished her cigarette about fifteen minutes before, but had been too engaged in the movie to light another one. The only other time that happened was when she was sleeping.As the movie draws to a close there is a sequence where a passing alien ship notices the warp signature of the first human vessel to travel faster than light. The aliens set down beside a small settlement in Montana, in search the people that built or flew that warp ship. More specifically, they are looking for Zefram Cochrane, the inventor of the ships engine. They step out of their craft, and you see that they look a lot like us, clothed simply in humble hooded robes. When the captain, or emissary, approaches Cochrane he removes his hood revealing his swept up eyebrows and pointed ears. They are Vulcans. At that moment my grandma let out a joyful whoop and clapped her hands. Her smile was three feet wide.If you have even a passing interest in Star Trek you know how pivotal this moment is to the entire series. You probably knew who the aliens were long before the reveal. My grandma knew. She knew every frame of that scene before she ever saw it. You see, my grandma was a scifi nerd. I don&rsquo;t know that I have ever met, or will ever meet, anyone with a more encyclopedic knowledge of scifi and fantasy stories than her. Stacks and stacks well worn paperbacks from Andre Norton, Anne McCaffrey, Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein, among many, many others lined the walls of her room, and filled several more boxes. And those were only the books that she had kept. Countless other books and short stories lived in her memory, and she could recall the details of each with lighting speed. She would emphatically inform me of the difference between &ldquo;good science fiction&rdquo; and &ldquo;crap&rdquo; at any opportunity. I lapped it all up.What I didn&rsquo;t fully realize at the time was that my grandma was several thousand years old. In her life, she absorbed so many stories, so many past and future events, so many possibilities, so many eventualities, and she had weighed and considered them all. Intelligent machines, faster than light space travel, contact with alien life. These weren&rsquo;t figments of fantastical imaginings for my grandma. These were very real, inevitable events. She had lived each of them dozens of times, in dozens of ways. How they would actually play out was anyone&rsquo;s guess, but she had her favorites. Stories that were as romantic as they were real. Benevolent aliens, greeting us for the first time, with a warm handshake, like family we never knew. That was the kind of story she loved.Thank you for sharing your love of stories with me, grandma. I miss you.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI'm gonna try to write a novel. Probably a bad one. I definitely won't be doing any editing. It won't be polished. It might not make sense. I'm gonna try anyway.I have side-eyed NaNoWriMo (as well as Inktober, and other creative jam type events) for years. I have participated in several Game Jams (create a game in a few days alone or with a team). I have usually found the experience to be sort of rejuvenating. Packing that much effort into a short space of time can be exhausting, but I usually come out with way more ideas and energy than I went in with. At least after a good nights sleep.NaNoWriMo is National Novel Writing Month. Over the course of November, people from all over try to write 50000 words. A novel.There is no rule or guideline on content, genre, or quality. It's just about getting the words out.&nbsp;I will try it. Hopefully I can type enough to reach 50000 words. I have absolutely no ide what I will write. It's an absolutely terrifying prospect.&nbsp;&#8203;I hope it's fun.&nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tFor the past few months I have been trying to sell stories. Sell is a bit of a stretch I suppose. All the outlets that I have been sending them too would not have paid me much for them. In terms of per hour wages, I would be making less than pennies off these stories. That&rsquo;s not really what I&rsquo;m trying to do though is it? I&rsquo;m not looking to get wealthy off these stories. I want people to read them.I thought a lot about why. I thought maybe it was attention seeking, or validation, or some other ego issue. While all writing has a component of that, I&rsquo;m not so sure that covers it anymore.I have received a good handful of rejection letters. Not a ton, but more than a few. The last 3 have been of the &lsquo;higher level&rsquo; variety. It seems there is a whole tier system for rejection letters. Almost all rejection letters people get are form letters, because the editors of magazines and podcasts receive a lot of submissions and don&rsquo;t have time to respond to all of them with personalized criticism or comments. This makes perfect sense. What a lot of publishers do have is a set of modular rejection letters. They tack on bits and pieces depending on what feedback they want to send but don&rsquo;t really have time to type out. Writers collect these letters to share and compare. They break them down into their component parts. The practice even has a name. Rejectomancy. The practice is so widespread that the word rejectomancy doesn&rsquo;t set off this text editor&rsquo;s spelling filters.Since I can&rsquo;t help but research anything and everything, I have done some research on rejectomancy. I tend to think that a very simple &ldquo;Thanks, but we are going to pass&rdquo; is a good enough rejection letter. It tells me what I need to know and lets me send the story to some other outlet. As it turns out, it isn&rsquo;t that simple. Even in a form rejection letter there are a lot of little segments that publishers tend to add.There is the &lsquo;who&rsquo;s desk did this come from?&rsquo;. Usually it comes from &lsquo;the magazine&rsquo; or &lsquo;outlet&rsquo; and that would mean that a volunteer or contractor read the story and decided not to pass it up to the staff or editor. Then there is the editor&rsquo;s desk. Depending on if they use &lsquo;I&rsquo; or &lsquo;We&rsquo; that might mean that they read it or not. Sometimes they just thank you for your time, but sometimes they say that they would like you to consider them when you are submitting other work. While it would be easy to see this as just being polite, it turns out that it usually isn&rsquo;t, and depending on the outlet, when they say consider us with other work it means exactly that. They liked the story, but something about it didn&rsquo;t fit. Could be the word count, could be the subject matter, could be the tone, could be anything. Maybe they had three dreary stories that issue and they wanted something upbeat to fill it out. Your story was a downer and they passed rather than holding it for a later issue. Or they had to pick between the 5000 word story and the 6000 word story and one of them just fit the space better.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve gotten a couple of the &lsquo;thanks&rsquo; variety and some of the &lsquo;thanks, send more&rsquo; variety. I got a personal critique. I got at least one &lsquo;thanks, it was yours or another one and we went with the other one&rsquo;. A bummer, but also kind of encouraging.Now that I have a few, I think rejection letters tell you what you are really looking for. If you were trying to please your ego, you would quit after receiving one or two. They do nothing good for the ego. I don&rsquo;t quit though. I do some revisions and send them out again. And again. And again.I&rsquo;ve stopped submitting all scattershot. Instead I go out and look for the right place to send these stories, and I realize that it&rsquo;s less about someone telling me that they like the story and more about getting it to the audience that would appreciate it. People who might read it and have it be important to them in some way. I want to give them away. I am making them to share. Of course I want people to like the stories, but I think, as I have gone through this process, It&rsquo;s much less important that people like me.If I could write a story that means something to someone else, someone that I have never met and will never meet, I think that is what I want. Publishing to these outlets is just the quickest way to get there. I could post them up here, where a dozen or so people would ever read them, but that&rsquo;s not good enough. They need to get out of here and go have a life away from me. They need to have people read them or listen to them without ever having any idea who I am. They need another place to vouch for them and say &lsquo;it&rsquo;s okay, these are stories you might like&rsquo; to people far, far away from this keyboard that they came out of.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll always love them, but I want them gone and off to their own adventures.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThis is a picture. I made this picture. This picture gives me anxiety.         There is a state that all drawings and paintings go through that can be best classified as &ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s the state that makes an artist want to cover the paper so people looking over your shoulder can&rsquo;t see your mess. People who are not the artist might, rightly, think that this is as good as it will get and walk away disappointed. I have worked very long and very hard on myself to break the impulse to cover my paper.I&rsquo;ve been here before. Every time I draw, paint, write, model, texture, light, or animate anything, there is a point where the honest impulse would be to cover the paper. Hide the shame of a picture that is in that halfway and unfortunate state. Every time I hit that point, I feel it too. I think this picture, or story, or whatever, is always going to look like this and it will be terrible, and I am terrible, and why did I even try doing this thing in the first place.Like I said though, I&rsquo;ve been here before. I know what this feels like. I recognize what the unfortunate state looks like. Foggy as it might be, I can see the road ahead because it&rsquo;s the one I walk every time I make anything. This unfortunate, halfway state is exactly that, halfway. Maybe a little more or less than halfway, but still, not the start or the end.&nbsp;I will do some more work on this painting, and the story that goes with it. Both are in a similar state. They will get better. At some point they will be &lsquo;done&rsquo;. That point isn&rsquo;t now, but that&rsquo;s okay.&nbsp;Artists should get used to showing off their process and their half-done work. The more you do it, the less scary it is. Being unafraid of the process of making things is probably the biggest hurdle an artist will ever have to leap.Show off your bad work. Your stuff that is half done and mushy. Your thoughts half formed and half finished. Get used to working through that and improving them. This is what your creations look like today, just imagine how good they could look tomorrow.&nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI played a game that reinforced an opinion I have. I know, super scientific. I have, and will, substitute this opinion for actual research.It&rsquo;s a simple thing, but since this is more or less a notebook to my future self (who won&rsquo;t go back and read it) I&rsquo;ll jot it down here.The most important thing to get right in a video game is control. It&rsquo;s not graphics, it&rsquo;s not sound, it&rsquo;s not even &lsquo;gameplay&rsquo;. The single most important element of any video game is control.If you watch a movie, the most important element is editing. If the editing is bad you won&rsquo;t be able to follow the narrative. Second is sound. The visual quality can be trash, but if the movie sounds good. Mess up on editing and sound!?!? Forget about it. That movie won&rsquo;t work.Video games share a lot with movies and TV. They are all primarily visual mediums. They all have to deal with pacing, rising and falling tension, timing with soundtracks. The primary difference, you swap editing with control.Ever since pong, the feeling of &lsquo;I do this thing with a button or a switch or a knob and something happens on the screen&rsquo; has been the primary differentiator between video games and all other media. I do this, the game does that. That feedback loop has to be nearly instant for it to feel good.&nbsp;Pong is a 2D game where input typically occupies a single plane. You turn the knob one way and the paddle goes up, you turn it the other way and it goes down. Simple.Modern games have controls that operate on multiple planes with separate fine scale inputs on triggers and paddles and buttons and touch pads and touch screens and capacitive sensors and accelerometers and gyroscopic sensors and motion tracking and computer vision and outside in or inside out position tracking systems.&nbsp;Exactly the same rules apply. When you do this, the game does that. And it must do that thing reliably and quickly and without disorienting the player. That is the end to end extent of the task. Do the thing, do it quickly, don&rsquo;t do some other thing the player isn&rsquo;t expecting.When a game is bad, it&rsquo;s almost always because they messed up on control.&nbsp;Now that games are mostly 3D control often includes two in game entities. The thing the player is controlling and the camera that is showing it to you. It can be easy to imagine that these are separate problems. Like driving a car is the first problem and building a good chase camera is the second. It&rsquo;s not. Those are the same problem. When the player presses a stick or trigger button the car has to react properly, quickly, and without doing anything unexpected, but so does the camera.There is often a delay on the camera that lets it float a long lazily behind the action, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it isn&rsquo;t reacting quickly. It needs to respond instantly to player input, and sometimes that means that the camera doesn&rsquo;t stay right behind the car. Sometimes that means that the camera follows the motion vector of the car or refuses to float back behind the car because, at that exact moment, the car is in a drift and it feels more natural to see the car from the side or front. It is about responding quickly to the player's expectation of where the camera should be going and giving them the best view of the game they are playing.&nbsp;With great controls, a pretty basic game can still feel fun to run around in. With poor controls, it won&rsquo;t matter how good the game is. There will always be a certain amount of people that will be turned off and put the game down.&nbsp;Controls are the editing of video games. Get them wrong, and the moment to moment just won&rsquo;t make sense.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - SSX 3The first SSX game was a banger right out of the gate. It could easily be in the running for a &lsquo;best games&rsquo; write up. It had a solid but sort of complicated trick system. It felt fast and smooth. It looked and sounded great. It was fun to play. All good. I think though, the third entry in the series is really something special.&nbsp;It was probably the Tony Hawk games that made extreme sports prime video game fodder. There were skateboarding and snowboarding games before that, but none of them had the same feeling of flow. The accuracy of control and speed and great looking tricks that make the player feel like they are floating from one obstacle to the next.&nbsp;There were a lot of imitators to the Tony Hawk formula. Like a lot, lot. Way too many. SSX sort of goes it&rsquo;s own way. The action sport element is there but after that, they are very different games.&nbsp;SSX captures the speed of snowboarding. It is trivial to go fast. It&rsquo;s not all about tricks and spins. It&rsquo;s about speed. And not just simple acceleration. The way you turn is fast. the way you recover from crashes is fast. The way you get in and out of events is fast. Everything in SSX happens fast.By the second game in the series, SSX Tricky, the core of the game was rock solid. You ride a snowboard down mountain slopes doing tricks and catching air. Do a big enough trick and you pull the board right off your feet and spin it around your head or something wild like that. But both the first two entries in the series still feel a little broken up. Each event is it&rsquo;s own track and you learn them, beat them, and move on.&nbsp;SSX 3 lets you ride a mountain.&nbsp;It is a proto open world type game that borrows a lot from some of the racing games of the time. You can start a run from a few different points along the mountain and do pretty much anything you want on the way down. Flips, spins, ride rails, pickup bonuses, do side missions, enter races, compete in trick contests. Or you could just glide down to the bottom of the mountain, ride back up and do it again.&nbsp;If you want to go to a race you ride to it. If you want to go to the shop and change your gear you ride to it. If you want to go to a different part of the mountain you ride to it. You can do any sort of grind, trick, or jump you want along the way.&nbsp;Some of the races can be difficult and frustrating, but fun is only a button press away. Whatever you find fun, you can do. You are never locked into anything.&nbsp;SSX On Tour would expand on the idea by making a single mountain that is massive and seamless from top to bottom, but SSX 3 got so much right already that it just seemed like a rehash of the same ideas.SSX 3 does the same stuff as the rest of the series, only more polished and geared toward fun above all else.&nbsp;In the years following, almost every sports or racing game that leaned toward goofy, fun, action would include an open world element. It might be a coincidence, but probably not.This is just one of those games that gets everything right.SSX 3 is one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI have been writing here for over ten years. Something like eight years of that has been once a week. Almost all of it I have done alone.&nbsp;Like, of course all the typing was done by me. That shouldn&rsquo;t be too surprising. It is, after all, very difficult for two or more people to use one keyboard. What I mean by writing alone is, I don&rsquo;t run any of this by an editor or second set of eyes. I just type it out and post it up. Including most of the stories. This is sort of a problem.Working with other people is always a bit of a challenge. Everyone will have competing ideas about how a thing should be done. If everyone is professional, cordial, and shares a mutual respect that doesn&rsquo;t need to be a source of conflict. I have worked together with other people to create things that are, by far, better than anything we would have done individually lots of times. I would even say that it&rsquo;s kind of fun. Bouncing ideas off each other. Building on ideas and making them better, funnier, deeper, richer. Working with other people can be a really good time.When I&rsquo;m writing I just haven&rsquo;t found the opportunity. Maybe it is more accurate to say that I haven&rsquo;t run into a willing collaborator.&nbsp;I have recently started running a lot of my stories past what people call Beta readers. Really just some friends that are willing to be subjected to very early versions of my stories. I&rsquo;m extremely grateful for that feedback but I also thought I could benefit from searching out a wider community. A group of people that don&rsquo;t know me, have no reason to be nice to me, and could care less if I wrote or didn&rsquo;t. You know, a writers group.&nbsp;First I posted a few things on Reddit under the destructive readers group. I didn&rsquo;t feel I was getting much actual feedback there. I still jump in and give some people notes on their work because I had hoped that was what they would do for me, but yeah, you can post stuff there and not get a lot back.I tried joining a writing group here in the city, but that was right before Covid made in person meetups an impossibility. They only have a facebook and yahoo group and I use neither of those.&nbsp;I have had a lot of luck using Discord with game development groups so I started looking there. I found one in Edmonton (only a few hours away and somewhere I regularly travel) but they chased me out because I didn&rsquo;t live in Edmonton. Out of an online group. That can only meet online right now. Strange, but whatever.&nbsp;I joined two other groups, but left one almost instantly when I discovered everyone else was high school age.So now I am testing out this third one. The people seem okay, but they are definitely much younger than me. Not that surprising with an all online group. I have offered some feedback on writing posted, but I have yet to receive any for my own. Maybe it will turn out to be helpful, maybe it won&rsquo;t. Maybe I&rsquo;ll hop out of here and head over to a different group. We&rsquo;ll see.&nbsp;What I do know is, I think I am done with doing this all alone. If I want my writing to get better, I need some other people to work with.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThis is where I would usually post part of a story I&rsquo;m working on. Since it seems I can&rsquo;t do that if I ever want to sell the thing, instead I will write this short blurb.&nbsp;I have, at any point, two to four stories that I am working on. I find that the way my brain works, it&rsquo;s better to have a few going rather than trying to plow through one that may or may not be working. Right now I have two main stories that are anywhere from a quarter to three quarters done. At least the first draft. Each of them will be around five thousand words.&nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t take a long time to type up five thousand words. A few hours maybe. Putting together a story can take days, or weeks. It isn&rsquo;t getting the words out that is the problem, it&rsquo;s pacing, tone, pov, style. Working out the puzzle of what set of words works best for the feeling I&rsquo;m trying to convey. That stuff takes time. Or at least it can.I got about 3000 words into one story when I realized it wasn&rsquo;t hitting like I wanted. I tried to solve that puzzle. It wasn&rsquo;t working. So I switched gears and moved to the other story. The other story started strong but quickly floundered. I switched back. I got a little more done on the first story. I went back and forth like this for at least a week.One morning I was exercising and one of the two stories solved itself. My brain had been running it as a background process for several days and then &lsquo;pop&rsquo; it laid itself out. Beat to beat to beat.&nbsp;I moved some style choices from one story to the other and I was off and writing again.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think there is any such thing as waiting for inspiration. To make anything you have to work through the steps and build it a little at a time. I didn&rsquo;t have &lsquo;writer's block&rsquo;. I didn&rsquo;t wait for the muses to speak to me. I was doing the work. Chipping away at the task.&nbsp;I get that the process I outlined above can make it seem like I waited and then all of a sudden, out of the blue, I thought of the whole story. It absolutely did not happen that way. I considered the problems, attempted to tackle them in many different ways and then, having solved several smaller puzzles, the solution to the larger puzzle came into view. It just happened to be when I was exercising and not when I was writing.&nbsp;Stories are as much a mechanical puzzle as they are an emotional puzzle. Getting the words out efficiently and in the right order is part of the problem. Making them land so that the reader feels what you want them to feel is the other. It&rsquo;s not enough to solve one or the other. They need to be solved together. Sometimes solving those puzzles can seem like magic. It can happen all at once. It can be surprising and exciting. In my experience, the only way to solve the puzzles is by doing the work. Gradually, even slowly, grinding through the problems until they are all complete. Sometimes that means that you get a clear picture of the whole thing early, sometimes it can seem to take ages.&nbsp;It would be nice to think that one second I was spinning away on the elliptical and the next I had a fully formed story in my head, but that wouldn&rsquo;t be the truth at all. I have pages of notes. I have many cut paragraphs and chunks of story written two, three, or four different ways. I did the work, solved the problems. After I had solved enough of the small ones I was able to solve the large ones all at once.&nbsp;Now I only have the other story to fix, because that one isn&rsquo;t working at all.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

How about if you never have to stop shooting. You want an action game. Gunblade never lets up. You want a short game you can enjoy for a few moments in an arcade or bar. Gunblade is only minutes long. You want to play with a friend. The game expects that you will.&nbsp;This is a game that knows what it is, and more importantly what it isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s quick, it&rsquo;s fun, it&rsquo;s ridiculous.&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s go back a bit. SEGA has a pretty good track record with light gun games. Most of that is on their consoles. Just a bit prior to Gunblade NY, Sega had a huge arcade hit with Virtua Cop. Virtua Cop is what you get when you take these newfangled polygon 3D game and pair it with tried and true lightgun shooting. Gunblade is what you get if you take all the best parts of Virtua Cop and get rid of everything else. All that&rsquo;s left is high speed robot shooting action out the side of a physics defying helicopter. With a rip roaring soundtrack.In a lot of these Best Games posts I like to look at a game that did one thing better, or earlier, or different, than all the other games. Something that blazed a trail. A game that designers can look to as a touchstone of the artform. Every once in a while it&rsquo;s worth looking at a game that just does what it does very well with no missteps. A small, simple game that never claims to be more than it is.In that same spirit, this is a small simple post that is only here to praise Gunblade NY. If you get a chance to play it, you should. Gunblade NY is one of the best games.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThis weekend was the Alberta Game Jam. You know what I did. I didn&rsquo;t do the Alberta Game Jam.&nbsp;I thought about it. I registered for it. I forgot about it. I noticed a message about it a few hours before it was going to start. I watched the theme reveal. I got an idea for a game I could work on. Then I didn&rsquo;t.I don&rsquo;t really feel bad about that.Since using Twine a few years ago for a game jam, I have thought about using it again.Twine is a sort of framework for text based, choose your own adventure and interactive fiction. It&rsquo;s fairly easy to use and surprisingly powerful and flexible. As long as the game you are making is primarily text based.&nbsp;When I made that previous jam game, I came up with a way to use 2D arrays for maps and navigation could be handled semi procedurally. I then found out that other people had the same idea and there were instructions and frameworks for just such a system. I ended up making a sort of hybrid. Taking parts of the system I found and the system I came up with to make something that worked for the random escape game I created.&nbsp;Like all jam games, there were ideas that I wanted to implement that I ran out of time for. Like most jam games, I never went back to add those features.&nbsp;I thought &ldquo;here we go&rdquo;. I had the opportunity and the idea that would let me add those missing elements to that Twine framework.So I sat down and added those features.I tested those features.The features worked.And I was done.I found I didn&rsquo;t really have any interest in making the game. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been great. I don&rsquo;t think I would be that happy with it. What I really wanted to do was tinker with that engine and add the stuff that I wasn&rsquo;t able to before. Once I did that, well, I was done. And that&rsquo;s just fine.Sometimes you just want to make something. That something might not be that useful, or something that you need to share with others. Sometimes you just have to make a thing for your own damn self.&nbsp;So I did. And I liked it. And I was okay with finishing it there and moving on to some other writing that I do want to complete. Something that I do want to get into a state that I can share with others. So I changed gears and did that instead.&nbsp;All in all, not a terrible use of a weekend.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Bushido BladeOne perfect stroke. Perfectly timed. Perfectly executed. That is what we are told wins a sword fight.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I don&rsquo;t ever plan on being in a sword fight. It seems dangerous. All ,like, sharp and whatnot. Stabby. I&rsquo;ll be content with sword fights of the virtual kind.Most fighting games, even the ones with swords, are not very realistic. I can hit a character in Soul Calibur with a giant axe and they will be back up and swinging a few frames later. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like that&rsquo;s how that would happen. Of course I&rsquo;ve never been in a sword fight, so what do I know.I have played Bushido Blade. There are no health bars. No timers. No points. In Bushido Blade one slice to the legs or arms will maim. One good slash will kill .&nbsp; No counters, no reversals. Just stab and then dead. This makes every moment tense. Every button press counts. You can stand out of sword range or attempt to deflect an attack, but really, what you want to do is wait out your opponent and strike when they are defenseless. A match can last several minutes or a few seconds.&nbsp;Input in Bushido Blade is incredibly slow and deliberate. That might sound like a bad thing. Most fighting games benefit from snappy responsive control. The slow control is part of the game's design. You can&rsquo;t mash buttons in Bushido Blade. You can&rsquo;t jump in on your enemy. Nothing but steady precise attacks will win. The controls in Bushido Blade are telling you to slow down, focus, be patient, be decisive. Be a Samurai. Or at least pretend like you are a Samurai.Bushido Blade isn&rsquo;t the sort of game that gets played at tournaments. There aren&rsquo;t going to be many master level players out there. There is a level of luck involved in the outcome of a fight. Skill alone won&rsquo;t win. It just depends which player blinks first, strikes slowest, or misreads the opponent. Long stalemates are as common as instant wins. It&rsquo;s not the best fighting game. What it is, is uncompromising.When Bushido Blade was developed, the fighting game genre was in full swing. If you were looking to make a new one, there were many strong examples to &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; ideas from. Bushido Blade carved its own path. It&rsquo;s a path that I don&rsquo;t think any game will ever wander down again.Games are made to be enjoyed. There are a lot of aspects of Bushido Blade that are not enjoyable. Stiff controls, impossibly high penalties for failure, and a singular focus that is almost adversarial to a casual player. There are a lot of aspects of Bushido Blade that would never pass a focus group or play testing. The game would be labeled &ldquo;not fun&rdquo; and that would be that.&nbsp;What is here though, is incredibly compelling. You want to play round after round. You want to try different tactics, different weapons. You want to change up your attacks and play with adjusting stances. It&rsquo;s a game that you want to play. You want to understand how and why it was made. How an idea so pure and uncompromised made it to release as a commercial product.In spite of itself Bushido Blade is an excellent game and a really good time. There is some developer out there right now trying to capture that magic in their own uncompromised vision, and I wish them luck. Maybe they will be able to execute with one perfect stroke.Bushido Blade is one of the best games.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThis is a breakdown of my process on this painting so far.&nbsp;First I start with a sketch. I wanted to create a tall, inline composition for this one. Something that looked powerful and imposing, but with bright, rich colors.&nbsp;         I didn't really like the feature characters head position so I adjusted it from a downward stare, to a more imperious looking chin lift. I also made the foreground figure larger with a more reclined or off balance pose.&nbsp;         The basic composition was working for me, but the perspective of the feature character was sort of all over the place. I searched around for some better reference but didn't find anything that suited my needs. Remembering that I am a 3D artist, I posed a simple 3D character and set up a low angle camera. That image, along with the figure reference that I gathered (I literally just googled stuff like 'wrestler low angle' and 'athlete leaning')         Then it's on to colors. I picked a palette that I thought might be directly counter to the image. If the characters are about being powerful and imposing, the colors are the opposite of that. Pink and blue that strays into the pastel and neon.&nbsp;         And now it's time to refine the features, sculpt the characters with highlights and shadows and just generally start finishing the damn thing.&nbsp;         When I have it all wrapped up I'll post the final image. bit more to go.&nbsp;   \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t"

This is the sort of thing that might typically be done before any game assets get made or early in development. Since I am the one doing all the work on this game at the moment I&rsquo;ll do it in whatever order I damn well please. In this case that means I have set up a sort of feedback loop. The stuff I do in the game informs the paintings and vice versa. It&rsquo;s a nonlinear workflow.One thing that is absolutely linear for me though, I can&rsquo;t paint without first doing a sketch. Usually many sketches. So here is a set of sketches that I will be turning into a painting. Next week I will have more of a breakdown and I will walk through some of the process of making a painting.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI&rsquo;m just going to write this one as an aside.&nbsp;A little something that isn&rsquo;t what I am really writing. What I am really writing is another short story, but I have recently found out that if you actually want to get short stories published in places where people might read them you can&rsquo;t post them on your own personal blog. Now I understand the initial reasoning behind that. A publisher doesn&rsquo;t want to pay money for a story that can be found for free on the internet. I also think that sort of thinking ignores the realities of the internet. Almost anything can be had for free if you are willing to look around for it. Text is especially susceptible to being copied and redistributed. The other reality is that people are pretty lazy. The types of magazines and web sites that might publish one of my stories are probably safe. People aren&rsquo;t hunting around for pirated sci-fi stories. They are going to the outlets that they know. The places that curate stories. They are either listening to the ad sponsored podcast versions of stories, or paying a small amount for the digital subscription, or reading off the ad sponsored web page. That a story exists on my blog, a blog that very few people read, it won&rsquo;t really factor into their bottom line. Even if it were the blog of a very popular writer, there would likely be very little impact to a publisher.Still, they have their rules and that means that as long as I am trying to sell any stories I will have to either pull early drafts from here or just never post them to begin with. It&rsquo;s a bummer, but that&rsquo;s how it goes.I suppose if anyone reading this wants an early version of anything I am writing you could just contact me and I will hook you up.&nbsp;And now back to writing what I was writing before this aside. It involves aliens. And mixed martial arts. Should be fun.&nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Trial BikeImagine that all of the controls for a game exist on two axes. Up, down, backward, forward. That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s all. I mean, Pac-Man manages to operate on only two axes, so maybe it isn&rsquo;t that difficult to imagine. Now, how many games can you think of that both only use two axes for input and sparked a decades spanning franchise. A franchise that remains successful to this day? It&rsquo;s probably only Pac-Man and Trial Bike, or Trials, as the series would come to be known.I&rsquo;ll back up slightly. Trials, in the real world, is a competition where people riding motorcycles attempt to climb, hop, and navigate increasingly bizarre obstacles. Rocks, logs, concrete blocks, child play structures, stacked barrels. If you could find it in a landscaping storage yard, these folks will probably ride a motorcycle on it. Some of the obstacles are twice as tall as the riders zipping over them and they roll up these things like a squirrel climbing a tree. It&rsquo;s unreal to watch. I can honestly say that Trial Bike was my introduction to the sport. It&rsquo;s the sort of thing that would pop up on late night sports networks between infomercials. So, of course, It&rsquo;s amazing source material for a video game.Here we have this Finnish game from the early 2000s that borrows its theme from an obscure motorcycle obstacle course competition. The original game was made in Java and then ported to Flash. You could play it in a browser. Nothing about that description should make you think &lsquo;franchise spanning two decades&rsquo;, but new games in the Trails series come out at a fairly regular pace. Not only that, they are still made by the original developer. Now they are highly polished 3D affairs with lots of particle effects and ragdoll physics, but they haven&rsquo;t really deviated from the initial concept. Ride a motorcycle, climb obstacles, try not to crash. It just works.The other thing that works is the control scheme. Web games of the early 2000&rsquo;s were fairly simple out of necessity. There was no real way to stream high quality graphics to you at that time. You couldn&rsquo;t use a webGL plugin to play a game in your browser. Web games were quick things that you could drop a few minutes on here and there. Unfortunately that does mean that a lot of them have been lost to time. There probably aren&rsquo;t many that you would still want to play, but from a preservation standpoint, it&rsquo;s upsetting that some games might be lost forever. Tangents aside, the control scheme of Trial Bike is really something special.&nbsp;Like I said before, Trial Bike only uses two axes, or four buttons. Forward and back control the throttle and brake on your bike, up and down control where the rider balances their weight on the bike. When you press down the rider sits lower on the bike, but also further back on the seat. When you press up the rider stands and leans over the handlebars. Shifting the riders weight changes how and where your bike grips the ground. Press down and forward on the throttle and you can make you bike do a wheely. Press up and slam on the brakes kicks your back wheel up into an endo. Feather each of these controls just right and you are doing some Trials! You climb straight up that pipe that looked impossible to scale. You hop those boxes and land each tire perfectly straddling a dangerous gap. You ride just on the edge of control. You only use four buttons.&#8203;The legacy of Trial Bike is sort of a wild one and it&rsquo;s really no surprise. Trial Bike is one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\t       Two weeks ago I posted up a painting. This is one of a series of concept paintings that I have been doing for my game. The aim with all of these paintings has been to create a sort of 70&rsquo;s album cover aesthetic. The sort of fantasy art that would have been printed on 12 inch vinyls.&nbsp;While I could have tried to just straight up copy the style of someone like Roger Dean, that would never have felt like something that I would actually paint. Instead, I started shifting whatever my own style is in the general direction of 70&rsquo;s fantasy art.The last painting I did was fine. I like some elements of it. The figure has some good energy and the palette fits the era, but I just didn&rsquo;t like the painting. That happens. I think I actually like about three paintings from the entire series. Sometimes I don&rsquo;t even like those. I read recently that the reason artists don&rsquo;t like their own art is because it looks like they made it. I can second that. Anything that looks like I made it, I&rsquo;m usually not that interested in.Just to be absolutely clear, I am not some self flagellating artist. I don&rsquo;t have a perfectionist complex or think that nothing is ever good enough. I&rsquo;m just not that interested in looking at stuff I made, because I remember making it. More than that, I know that I can always do more. It&rsquo;s very easy to see the potential in a thing that I made because I typically have no fear of changing it. If I want to repaint a thing, I repaint it. No big deal. When I look at someone else's art I get to dissect it. I can imagine how it was made and reverse engineer the stroke choices, the techniques, the tricks. That is much more interesting to me.Since that last painting wasn&rsquo;t really doing it for me, I decided to try again. Usually I like to move on and paint something new since I will probably learn more from painting something new. This time I painted the same subject with a similar composition, but I attempted a bunch of the techniques I have been gathering from 70&rsquo;s album art.Maybe it&rsquo;s successful, maybe it isn&rsquo;t. That isn&rsquo;t really for me to judge. I mean, I made it. I enjoyed making it. But I did make it, so I don&rsquo;t really find it that interesting. Time to move on to the next one. &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Death RallyThis post is not really about a game. I mean, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Death Rally is great. It&rsquo;s as much fun now as it was when it launched as an Apogee published shareware title 25 years ago. This post is about first steps.In 1995 a group of Finnish demo scene kids set out to make a game.Let&rsquo;s walk this back a little. The demo scene, if you&rsquo;re not familiar, might be described as a loose network of extreme hacking clubs. These are the type of people that like to make dazzling animations set to electronic music on Commodore 64 and Amiga Machines. Sometimes long after the usable lifetime of the machine. They like to compact an unreasonable amount of data into a miniscule space just to watch it sing and dance. These are the type of folks that want to see what they can make a computer do. They are most often European. Not sure why. It might have something to do with the Amiga.This group of demo scene kids had been dabbling with the PC. In 1990, no one would have tried to make a fast action game on a PC. PC&rsquo;s were primarily business machines. Beige monoliths with green and amber crt screens. Good at crunching numbers, awful at moving pixels. Machines much more suited to spreadsheets than Mario. In five short years PC&rsquo;s went from ascii art to Commander Keen to Doom. Formidable graphics and sound advancements, along with the concept of shareware, had made the PC the place to play for up and coming developers.That&rsquo;s the world that this group of Finnish demo scene kids were working in. They knew how to make a PC sing, and they wanted to try their hand at making a game. They pitched a car combat game to Apogee, the shareware people, and got to work. They needed some writing done, so they got their friend who was studying English literature to do it. They were in the right place at the right time, yes, but they had arrived there with the right skills.&nbsp;Death Rally is a PC take on arcade and console driving games like Super Sprint and Badlands. It remains a great game to pick up and play. The controls feel great and the car combat is satisfying, if maybe a bit too difficult. It looks like a SNES or Genesis game that got dislodged from its cartridge and somehow ended up on a PC floppy disk. Suffice to say, the game is great but the real reason I selected Death Rally for a Best Games has less to do with the game and more to do with who made it.The team at Remedy who made Death Rally went on to create Max Payne, Alan Wake, and Control. Some of those same demo scene kids are still there, still at it, making dazzling images set to phenomenal music. Death Rally was a first step. It&rsquo;s a very good one. While their games diverged from Death Rally in terms of genre and point of view, one ingredient remains. You can tell that these games are made by people that aren&rsquo;t aware of what the boundaries are. They don&rsquo;t know what the &lsquo;right and proper&rsquo; way to make a game is. They are still demo scene kids trying to pack as much of everything they love into every single game. As a result the pacing and tone of each of their games is slightly different than what most studios would make.&nbsp;So there it is. As a first step, Death Rally is really quite phenomenal. Go give it a try. It&rsquo;s one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tFirst, write something.I write a lot here about games. I write here about game development. I write about art. I sometimes even write about movies. I write about all of these things, and even though I have been writing about them for about ten years, I never really write about something I spend a lot of my time doing. Writing.It&rsquo;s tough. I feel like I know a fair bit about the subject of games. Games and movies are absolutely the entertainment mediums that I have spent the most time in my life enjoying and analyzing. While they may not always be great opinions, I do have opinions on those forms of art. That means it&rsquo;s pretty easy for me to rattle off a thousand words or so about some game or movie. The thoughts are all right there on the surface. I rarely write about writing because I don&rsquo;t really feel like I have a lot of expertise in the field. I have opinions, but I am absolutely not an on the subject.All that said, here are some thoughts on writing. At least how I do it. You can do it any way you like. If you have been thinking that you would like to write something but didn&rsquo;t know where to start, this post might give you some ideas about how to get going. And more importantly, how to keep going when you feel stuck.If you read this page at all regularly, it probably won&rsquo;t come as a surprise to you that I don&rsquo;t edit these posts very much. I read them over (usually). I fix major mistakes (usually) but I don&rsquo;t pore over them. I don&rsquo;t test and compare word choices or sentence structure. These are stream of consciousness posts, for the most part. When I write stories though, that is an entirely different beast.When I write stories I like to get a first draft out of my head as quickly as I can. I stick to the concept and sort of see where it leads. I have been informed that this is the panster method. As in &lsquo;by the seat of your pants&rsquo;. The opposite of the pantser method is the plotter method, where you plot out every beat of your story before writing. So I suppose I am sort of a pantser-plotter, because when I edit, I like to plan.&nbsp;Once the first draft is down and out of my head I feel like I have stuff to play with. Some paint to smear around. Some clay to work into shape. It gets fun, but also a little frightening. What if I plop the wrong paint daub down or lop off the wrong bit of clay. Something that was working might now look like a heap of word trash. That&rsquo;s the fear and adventure of editing.&nbsp;I open up a new document, or several new documents, and start making plans. I write out timelines. I gather research notes. I write short character biographies. All of this stuff will be only for me. Then I start working my way through the story pulling out parts, changing them, moving them around the timeline, clarifying them, and weaving them back into the rest of the story.I take most of my inspiration from film so I tend to write in scenes. This is helpful for me since I can usually pull a scene out, change it, and put it back without disrupting the scenes around it. At least not too much. When I plan, each one of these scenes is usually represented by one or two lines that sum up what happens, and why the scene exists. The &ldquo;why the scene exists&rdquo; part is especially useful when it comes to cutting or removing scenes. Lots of times changing one scene will make another scene redundant and it becomes easier to pull it out. Of course I never just delete a scene. I cut it out and paste it into my orphan scene document, where all the ideas I liked but didn&rsquo;t work go to spend languishing in digital eternity.&nbsp;All of this is probably pretty standard editing workflow stuff. I&rsquo;m sure there are tricks and techniques that authors use all of the time that dwarf my feeble nonsense. I&rsquo;ll keep adding those tools as I carry on learning to write.I think that might be the part I like about writing. There will never be any end to it. There will always be something new to learn. Some way to get better. Some new way to string one word after another to tell a story, or describe a process.Really, I just bang out my thousand or so words here once a week and then write a few thousand more in the times between. That makes me feel like I accomplished something. It might never grow to anything larger than that, but I suppose that is okay too.&nbsp;While writing this post, I removed two full paragraphs that didn&rsquo;t need to be here. I changed a few dozen sentences, and several hundred words. That&rsquo;s about as stream of consciousness as I get. So that distills it. My advice on writing anything. First, write something. Then read it to see if it makes any sense. Then change the parts that don&rsquo;t. That may sound too simple but it&rsquo;s that first step. The one that starts everything. First, write something.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - The Outer WildsMovies are linear, plays are linear, songs are linear, books are linear. They can all contain stories told from start to middle to end. There are Choose Your Own Adventure books and even some Choose Your Own Adventure style video things, but they are all, at their core, linear. You can make choices that change the moment to moment story, but you can&rsquo;t experience that story in a way other than the way the authors intended. You can try but it just won&rsquo;t make any sense.The linear nature of stories isn&rsquo;t a limitation. It&rsquo;s a feature. Imagine trying to decipher a film that has been chopped up and rearranged in a random order. Each edit decoupled chronologically from the ones before or after it. I&rsquo;m sure it would make the rest of your experimental film class very happy, but no one else would want to watch it. Our squishy meat brains can&rsquo;t deal well with non-linear time. I mean, we can intellectualize it. We can wrap our minds around the idea of it. We just aren&rsquo;t very entertained by it.&nbsp;Now imagine this scenario. You walk out into the woods. You come across an abandoned cabin. Inside that cabin are the remnants of a life you weren&rsquo;t aware of until now. Bits of writing. The places where people slept and ate. Things they collected but were unable to take with them when they left. You gaze around at all of this and then head back home. All of those tableaux tell a story through clues and inferences. It&rsquo;s a story that you build in your head during the quiet parts of your hike. These sights become a story that you tell to yourself.The story you create is linear. You left home, you saw things, you came back. Beginning, middle, end. It satisfies the arrow of time that our brains demand. But there was no authorial hand directing you to see the kitchen of the cabin before the bedroom. What is the story you tell yourself when you examine a poem etched into the doorframe before seeing the jar filled with potting soil or the yellowing single mattress? Is it different than when you see the unwashed dishes in the sink first? Does reading the signature on a painting determine what you think of the rest of the house? Does the story of the space feel different depending on how you experience it? This is storytelling through discovery and it is something only the real world, or a game, can do.&nbsp;There are a great many games that tell their stories through discovery. This style has a name. Environmental storytelling. Most times, environmental storytelling is additive to a more explicit linear story. A narrator or quest giver will direct the player down a path and the environmental storytelling will be used to fill in the gaps. Apparently, a lot of game devs imagine that a person might write on a wall with their own blood rather than attempting to stop bleeding it. Unlikely, but it does tell a story I suppose.The Outer Wilds is straight, uncut, and distilled environmental storytelling. Any bit of story, any strand of narrative, is something you, the player, must seek out or encounter on your travels. Not one bit of important story is required for you to &lsquo;beat&rsquo; the game. You can easily bypass all of it. The entire game can be finished in minutes, but there is enough story written and presented visually to fill dozens of hours. This story won&rsquo;t come to you. You will have to wander into those woods, open the door to that cabin, and find it for yourself. This can happen in literally any order. There are clues and processes that you discover while playing The Outer Wilds that will lead you to new mysteries and additional vignettes, but there are a lot of tales that you will come upon by chance.&nbsp;In your life there will be stories that you remember because they were told to you. Everyone has their own favorite childhood movie or book. The sort of thing that you will recall with nostalgia years and decades later. These stories will be important because they mirror or inform a part of your life. Songs will bring back memories of impactful moments. These stories are tied to you, but they are separate from you. Distinct. Maybe more important are the stories you experience.The Outer Wilds has its own story to tell. It&rsquo;s a story that is as grand as it is simple and personal. It is melancholic, joyus, introspective, and harrowing. Most important, it is a story that you can only experience. No one can tell you this story second hand. You can&rsquo;t watch a video of that first descent into the maelstrom of Giant&rsquo;s Deep and feel what the game is presenting to you. Multiple trips into Dark Bramble wouldn&rsquo;t stick with you unless you have felt your own pulse quicken in preparation for the trek. Stitching together the tales of Nomai travellers who came before you would have no impact if they were read from a script. They need to be found and discovered and mined for meaning. Each scrap of text landing harder as they lock, puzzle like, into empty spots in this story that you are telling to yourself.&nbsp;The Outer Wilds is a walk in the woods where you stumble across a splayed out campsite. An abandoned cabin. A story that ended before you arrived. A story filled with danger and mystery and lightness and sadness. A story that you now have to tell yourself. It&rsquo;s a walk in the woods on a universal scale. It&rsquo;s also a small story that roots itself inside you, because the only way to really know this story is to experience it.&nbsp;The Outer Wilds will be remembered as a pivot point in video game storytelling. It might not be a thing that can be replicated or even emulated. It might be that only the relatively small number of people who will ever play it will carry that story with them. Without a doubt though, The Outer Wilds will be a touchpoint for every game developer and serious storyteller creating from this point on. In a medium that values experiences over traditional, linear, storytelling, it is an important artifact. The one that showed how it is done.I look forward to playing the descendants of The Outer Wilds style of storytelling. Truly some amazing experiences on the horizon.And storytelling is only one of the reasons that The Outer Wilds is one of the best games.&nbsp;Really, you should play it.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Moto RacerMoto Racer is a deeply unfair game. Every slight bend in the road could end your race. A mistimed button press could mean the difference between finishing first or last. Nailing every corner, every straightaway, every jump is absolutely required to win. That&rsquo;s on the medium difficulty. Moto Racer demands perfection.That might sound like a recipe for a bad game. Players typically don&rsquo;t want to trial and error their way through most games, let alone a racing game. Racing games are supposed to be about speed and timing and weaving through opponents. Taking advantage of opportunities when they present themselves. Balancing aggression with racing tactics. Moto Racer isn&rsquo;t that type of game.&nbsp;There is a certain joy in learning and then perfecting a system. Optimizing&nbsp;to the minimum number of movements in the shortest span of time. That is the type of game Moto Racer is. You are presented with a handful of tracks in two different modes. In the street racing mode it&rsquo;s all about speed and careful use of a turbo that boosts your bike forward, but also decimates your maneuverability. In motocross mode it&rsquo;s about drifting hairpin turns and hitting jumps with the right amount of speed so you land cleanly with your speed intact. In both modes you will have to hit buttons and lean your bike at exactly the right time lap after lap after lap.&nbsp;That&rsquo;s really what this game is about. Moto Racer doesn&rsquo;t boast a realistic physics model, or complex tracks, or deep upgrades. It&rsquo;s about learning the tracks, perfecting the tracks, and then trying to shave millisecond off your lap times. It feels like racing.You will not win the first time you play Moto Racer. Every time you start a new track, you will lose. It won&rsquo;t matter how well you did on the previous track. It is unfair in that way. It is unfair as a game. Run a track 5, 10, 20 times though, and you will start to memorize it. When to let off the turbo and when to open it up. How early to start a turn, and when to dive out of a corner. You will master the tracks and you will win. You will have earned it.Moto Racer might not be able to stand up to modern racing games, but the developers added something to the game that a lot of its current day counterparts lack. The heart pounding feeling of pushing your precision to the edge and succeeding.&nbsp;Moto Racer is brilliant and it&rsquo;s one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThis page will be moving. Again.&nbsp;I started this thing on Blogger. I only wrote about 20-30 posts before moving it all over to Weebly. I&rsquo;ve spent the last several years posting at least once a week to weebly and now I&rsquo;m moving again. It&rsquo;s just not the right platform for what I&rsquo;m doing.Last time the move wasn&rsquo;t too much of a problem. A couple dozen posts ranging anywhere from a few hundred words to just around a thousand. That was mostly just a copy and paste job. Well, copy, paste, and change some links and image locations.&nbsp;Now I have added more than 400 posts. A dozen short stories. Some interactive fiction. I can&rsquo;t really copy and paste all of that. I couldn&rsquo;t even begin to imagine manually fixing all of the images and links.&nbsp;Weebly doesn&rsquo;t offer a great way to download blog content so I had to rip my own site from their servers in a really clumsy way. It kinda of sucked, but I have all of the content sort of in a messy pile. Now I have to organize that pile into something I can put up again. So, what to do, what to do?I wasn&rsquo;t about to do it manually, so I wrote a program. A pretty simple C# program that sifts through the pile, pulls out each of the over 400 posts, dusts them off, updates the image locations, repairs as many of the links as it can, and writes them back into cleanly formatted new files with the proper names and dates. It isn&rsquo;t a complex program, but I don&rsquo;t really write this sort of thing so it was a bit of a challenge. It took the better part of a day to make sure that the resulting posts contain the bare minimum of errors. On the upside, it only took about a day. Trying to move them over manually would have taken ages and I can&rsquo;t imagine how monotonously soul crushing that task would have been. Just taking the chance that I would accidentally read an old post was too much to risk.&nbsp;I still have some organizing and design cleanup to do before I can fully move the site over to its new home. When that happens I will post again to mention any changes to the RSS feed. I have two or three bugs to squash before the full move but it should be no longer than a couple weeks away.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Burnout ParadiseDoes the idea of spinning donuts around the infield of a baseball stadium sound appealing? Would you like to launch a car off a ramp, sail an unreasonable distance, and nail a perfect 4 wheel landing losing no momentum? Would you like to nudge a supercar into a barrier and watch it crumple like foil knowing there would be no consequences or injuries? What if you could drive impossibly fast not only over the road, but through buildings, on train tracks, on park pathways, and more? Burnout Paradise has you covered.Burnout Paradise might be a perfect driving game. You will notice that I didn&rsquo;t write &lsquo;Racing Game&rsquo;. Burnout Paradise is a driving game. It&rsquo;s an exploration game. It&rsquo;s a toy car sandbox game. There is racing in it but it&rsquo;s not, strictly speaking, a racing game. The draw of the game is not the racing. I suppose for some people it might be but the game isn&rsquo;t really designed around the racing. It&rsquo;s designed around the driving.No matter what you do in the open world of Burnout Paradise, the game tracks it. How far you drive. How fast you drive. How much time you spend in the air. How many flips and spins you do. How many cars you crash, both your own and your opponents. If it&rsquo;s a trackable stat the game probably tracks it. The game tracks it and then rewards you for it. It incentivizes driving over winning races or completing challenges. Burnout Paradise is a game about driving.There are a lot of people who didn&rsquo;t like it when the Burnout series shifted from the focused event based structure to a flowing open world with potential events at every intersection. There were complaints that it took too long to get from one event to another, or that it was too easy to get lost in the labyrinth of city streets and shortcuts. Not liking a game is no real crime. There are and were certainly other games for people who didn&rsquo;t enjoy the open world of Paradise, but I can&rsquo;t help but feel like they missed the point.It&rsquo;s a driving game not a racing game.The events are secondary to the reason you load the game up. You play Burnout Paradise to drive. You play it to drive in the most irresponsible and chaotic way possible. You play it to manifest fantastical driving situations. You play it to enjoy the feeling of speed and impact and exploration.Burnout Paradise is about driving and it is one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tImagine you were to get to see some amazing old sculpture. A real museum piece. The Venus De Milo. You get your eyes on the Venus De Milo. You&rsquo;re looking at it and you want to steal it. There is a museum curator watching you, there are security guards, other museum patrons, etc. There is absolutely no way they will let you do that. Also, the statue has to weigh close to 2 tons. You aren&rsquo;t going to be hauling it out on your back, but you can take a picture of it. Maybe a lot of pictures. Maybe a lot of pictures with a camera that can capture depth and minor variations in the surface of the marble. Pits, cracks, dust, all of it. You and your camera take a quick buzz around the Venus snapping shots the whole way, and bug out.Now that you have all of this information in images, it should be possible for you to start with a blank approximation of the Venus De Milo and recreate all of those details. Will it be exactly the same? No, of course not. Could you deceive the other art thieves with it? Will it look convincing enough from a distance to get you into all of the art thief parties? Only one way to find out.&nbsp;Now since I do most of my art stealing digitally and figuratively, I set up a tool to make that high detail image capture easier.&nbsp;You see, when you set up digital 3D models for use in real time applications, that is exactly what you do. You take heavy, detailed, high resolution art and you crush it down to something that a computer can draw to a screen 30, 60, 90, or 120 times a second. The better you can steal that detail and pack it up into images, the more convincing the final result will be.&nbsp;Some stuff I have been working on required nice seamless tiles of high detailed fakery. There are tools and techniques that let you do this, but most of them are clumsy, slow, or expensive. I spent some time this past week to fix that.&nbsp;Just to be clear, I haven&rsquo;t made anything revolutionary here. This isn&rsquo;t some sort of stand alone tool. I put together the equivalent of a carpenters jig. A simple tool that helps you to do a more complicated job more easily.If that sort of thing doesn&rsquo;t seem up your alley you can bail now. It&rsquo;s okay, I get it. I&rsquo;m going to break down how I set up one of my tools in Blender.Let&rsquo;s start with the camera. I set up a single orthographic camera right above my work area and set the orthographic scale to 2. I set it to 2 because I will be using a 2x2 plane as the extents of my texture. You can set it to whatever size you like, but I find this works for me.         &nbsp;I also set its render size to 4096 x 4096. You could set it to 2k or 8k or whatever size you want, but I wanted nice high resolution square textures at the end of this process. Your textures don&rsquo;t need to be square, but that&rsquo;s for you to decide.         You will also notice that I set the output to the openEXR file format. This isn&rsquo;t strictly necessary&nbsp;but openEXR can contain a 32bit color depth and a linear color profile. sRGB non-linear color spaces, like 59.94hz NTSC signals, is one of those things that should probably be un-invented. Since we can&rsquo;t do that, keeping your textures in a linear format, while not entirely required, is good texture hygiene.&nbsp;Under Render Properties I set the display device in the color management dropdown to None. This prevents visual color crunching from alternate color profiles.         This is what the camera setup looks like with a 2x2 plane under it. Not really very interesting but it works.&nbsp;         Now that the camera is taken care of I need to model something under there. I quickly made up this screw head, since it&rsquo;s the sort of thing that you wouldn&rsquo;t want to model a thousand of and is a great candidate for casting off to the 2D world of texture images.         And this is what the camera sees.         That&rsquo;s great and all but not really useful. To make it useful I needed to set up some materials.&nbsp;This is what the same screw head looks like when I apply a normal shader to it. The normal shader encodes, in rgb pixels, the way that light would bounce off of a surface if it were 3 dimensional rather than 2 dimensional. The colors represent the deviation from the surface normal (perpendicular to the face). So it looks bumpy without actually being bumpy.&nbsp;&#8203;   \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t          \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t          \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t \t   And this is what it looks like when I apply a depth shader to it. This one colors the surface in a smooth gradient from black to white based on the distance between two objects. I made these objects two non-rendering empties because that was a useful way to represent them. You could use anything. The distance between world 0&nbsp; and the camera. The bounding box z dimensions of the model, or just some arbitrary numbers.   \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t          \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t          \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t \t   And this is the shader node graph for both the depth and normal shaders. I combined them for convenience and set up a switch to go between them, but you wouldn&rsquo;t need to do that.&nbsp;&#8203;         Since the entire depth graph is visible I will go over that first.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m passing all of these into an emission shader because emission is a pure representation of the output color we are looking for. No lights or shadows mucking things up. I get the position of the geometry that has the material applied to it with the geometry node and pass that to a Separate XYZ node. We are only interested in the Z position so I take that and pass it to a Map Range node. I want to take the distance between my two measurement objects, my ZMin and ZMax, and remap that distance to a 0-1 scale. This will give us a pure black to pure white gradient. I pipe that result into the emission shader and then pipe that to the material output. In this case I go though my mix shader for switching from depth to normal, but I wouldn&rsquo;t need to.You might notice that the ZMin and ZMax are purple. That is because those Value nodes contain a float driven by the Z position of my two measurement objects.&nbsp;You can drive damn near any value with any other in blender just by right clicking on the input field and clicking on add driver. It&rsquo;s something I don&rsquo;t do nearly enough of but it&rsquo;s very handy.         Now for the normal map. As you can see up there I use another geometry node (I could have used the same one, but whatever) and pass that into a node group that converts the normal vector into color data.This is what&rsquo;s in that node group.         I could absolutely clean this up and simplify it, but this is working. I&rsquo;m taking the normal vector and converting each channel into the appropriate color. It set up like this because I was messing with each of the channels for a bit to get them tuned. I might clean it up, but it&rsquo;s working now so I probably won&rsquo;t bother. The Combine XYZ node is doubling for a Combine RGB node, but numbers are numbers and Blender doesn&rsquo;t seem to care what node they come out of.I take the new colors, put them into an emission shader and we&rsquo;re almost done.Now for the real reason I put together this setup. Baking.The common workflow for this sort of setup is to make an empty image texture and &lsquo;bake&rsquo; the detail from your screwheads or whatever into that image texture. Then you save that out to a file and you&rsquo;re done. Great, right?.No, it blows. Baking is slow, uses a different render path than I&rsquo;m using to display the results, and sometimes contains artifacts and issues that you can&rsquo;t see before the bake is done. I had depth and normal maps where two adjacent pixels that should have had a lot of contrast between each other turn into a mushy mess when baking.To get the result out of the new method I use EEVEE (Blenders real time rendering engine) in the camera viewport and I press this.         Using this new method those pixels come out perfect. What you see is what you get. Not only that, but when reapplying the depth information, I now get perfectly sharp edges and details. What is the cost of this increased precision? Well I went from bake times I could measure in minutes to render times I can measure in seconds. More precise, faster, and easier to iterate. It&rsquo;s vastly better.&nbsp;Then it&rsquo;s a click of Image - Save As to save the OpenEXR file and I&rsquo;m done. I think that, in the future, I could set up a python script to run through the whole process for any maps I have to export and it could be a one click type of process. For now though, this works, and more important, it works so much better than baking.&nbsp;Of course this works for flat surface details. Stealing the detail off the Venus De Milo might take a bit more work, but I have some ideas about that I might sort out one day.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tLast Monday I posted a link. Just a link. The link led to the game that I finished during the Global Game Jam. Like everyone participating in the jam, I saw the theme on Friday, worked on the game Friday night and Saturday, and finished it up on Sunday.That&rsquo;s it. That is all the time you have to go from a topic to a concept to a finished game. Hopefully that&rsquo;s enough time because you won&rsquo;t be getting any more.&nbsp;Even if you manage to finish up a game in that amount of time, the game you make will likely be bad, but fair&rsquo;s fair, all games are bad in the first few days.&nbsp;I had one main goal going into this jam. I was going to make a 2D game. Every other jam game I have worked on, except the text based ones, have included some 3D modelling at some point. So that was my hard limit. No 3D. I also wanted to do something with really tight pixel and palette restrictions. I went with only 6 colours and a resolution of 160 x 144. That was the resolution of the original Gameboy. I figured if that was enough for Tetris it would be enough for me. I thought about using an entirely 2D engine or framework, but I opted to use Unity since I am the most familiar with it and time is limited during a game jam. I also decided to do this one solo. Meaning that everything that isn&rsquo;t included in the engine, I made. Graphics, I make em. Sounds, I make em. Game code, I write it. Physics&hellip; well physics comes with the engine but I did connect up all the systems to make a string that wouldn&rsquo;t just suddenly break for no apparent reason. Getting that to work was much more difficult than I had anticipated.Since I posted the game right after the jam, I have gone back to it and fixed up a couple of things to make it slightly less aggravating. It&rsquo;s not what I, or any person who enjoys things, would call good. It&rsquo;s bad, but at least it&rsquo;s bad in the way that I intended. Also the sound doesn&rsquo;t work in the web build. I&rsquo;m not sure exactly why, but it might be something to do with not having a Start or Intro screen. I usually try to avoid having an intro screen for jam games just as a sort of aesthetic choice. I want people to be in and playing the game instantly. No preamble. No lore dump. Just load it up and start playing. Seems like, in this case, I might need to create a start screen to get sounds to play during the rest of the game.&nbsp;I have participated in quite a few game jams. They are great for knocking the creative cobwebs off and getting you working and thinking about developing something functional. You don&rsquo;t have time to get bogged down in trying to create an elegant solution to every problem. You just have to make it work. And when the weekend is over, so is the project. That&rsquo;s it. You never have to think about it again. Game jams are excellent prototype, evaluate, and move on, training. I don&rsquo;t tend to go back to jam games trying to make them better or continue developing them. If they are broken, I leave them that way. For this one, I will probably make a slight exception. I would like the sound to work on the web build, but I don&rsquo;t want to put much time into fixing it. If I can get the sound working by adding a start screen, I suppose that is not a massive task. If that doesn&rsquo;t work I fear the game will be doomed to silence forever. And that will be okay. After all, it&rsquo;s a game I made over a literal weekend.&nbsp;I did learn the ins and outs of Unity&rsquo;s new input system, and that&rsquo;s pretty good. I did learn about the 2D side of the Unity physics system, and that&rsquo;s pretty good too. If I can get the sound working I will call the jam an unqualified success. Even if the game is sort of aggravating and not all that great. I&rsquo;ll see what I can do.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Police 911 - The KeisatsukanThis one is a bit of a bummer. Not because the game is bad. The title right there says Best Games, and this game is fantastic. No, it&rsquo;s a bummer because Police 911 is almost impossible to play now.I think every game that I have written about in Best Games is pretty easy to get a hold of and play. A lot of them are available to play through your web browser with no special setup at all. While that might not be the best way to play them, they are available.&nbsp;Police 911 is an arcade game that came out in 2000. It&rsquo;s a lightgun shooting game that makes heavy use of motion tracking years before the Nintendo Wii would popularize motion controls.&nbsp;First, here&rsquo;s specifically why it&rsquo;s a bummer. The only ways to play Police 911 are on an original arcade machine, or on a Playstation 2 port that was never released in North America. To play the PS2 port you will need to have a special Konami made usb camera and a Konami made light gun. You will also need a CRT screen. Also the PS2 will have to be able to play Japanese games. It&rsquo;s worth noting here that none of this equipment is currently being manufactured so you would have to scour the used market to acquire any of it. It&rsquo;s sort of a lot of kit to assemble just to play this one game, good as it is.That aside, here is why it was so good. Police 911 is sort of slow. Well, it&rsquo;s slow when it needs to be. You might say &lsquo;hey that sounds like a bad thing for an action game to be&rsquo; but being slow is what makes this game great. This is the arcade machine. It has a place for you to stand so that you are the perfect distance from the screen, properly centered, and directly beneath some sensors. Those sensors keep track of where your head is at all times. This means that while you are playing the game you can lean, duck, and sway all over the place and the game will know where you are. This also means that the in game camera will move around changing the view on the screen to match your current position. There are no 3D glasses and no headset to wear, but the feeling of immersion and depth comes very close to a VR experience. An arcade game in 2000, displayed on a standard definition CRT and using some fairly common infrared sensors could offer up a VR like experience. It does that because the gameplay is sort of slow. Only a small handful of enemies will pop out at each checkpoint in a level and they will tend to wait until you are exposed before unloading on you. Most of them will go down from one of your shots. It is better in Police 911 to duck behind cover, lean out only as far as you need to, take careful aim, and fire only as often as you need to. Standing still and spraying bullets will get you killed very quickly.&nbsp;The pace of the game forces you to use the movement mechanic and experience the immersion of having the view on screen track your head. That, in turn, makes you want to keep using the movement mechanic because just leaning around feels novel and fun. It&rsquo;s a nifty feedback loop of joy. Konami could probably have made an entire game focused only on looking around corners using this same sensor hardware and it still would have been a hit because moving around in Police 911 is so much fun.I like a lot of light gun games. I used to play Area 51 and Virtua Cop as both players with one gun in each hand. Getting an accuracy rating in the high 80s or low 90s on my left hand, my non dominant hand, was usually my goal. That is to say, I am pretty particular about how accurate light gun games are and how quickly you can move from target to target without the light gun letting you down. Police 911 (along with a lot of Konami light gun games come to think of it) is among the best. You can lean out, snap off 3 shots and drop 3 low poly bad guys in one movement. It plays great. If you can manage to play it.So, that&rsquo;s the conundrum. I thought about adding this game to the Best Games list a while ago, but I didn&rsquo;t want to add something that is pretty much impossible to play. I thought, what the hell. If you do somehow manage to spot this cabinet in the wild, you should absolutely play it, because it&rsquo;s one of the best games.&nbsp;       \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWe are in the time of lists. At the transition point from year to year it&rsquo;s customary to create lists. The best of, the worst of. The things that are memorable from the year gone by. A ranked index of towering works.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t plan on doing that.&nbsp;While we are closing out a year, we are also closing out a decade, and as far as video games are concerned maybe the best decade on record. Instead of making a &ldquo;best of&rdquo; list, I have written a completely unordered grab bag of games that I have enjoyed over the last 10 years. There were a lot of other games that I played and thought were great. This is far from comprehensive, but if you were looking for a good game to play, I don&rsquo;t think you can go wrong with any of the bunch below. I&rsquo;ll probably cover some of these games in longer Best Games pieces in the future, but I will keep the raving to a minimum here. I&rsquo;ll limit the commentary to why these games were important to me.Lets Go!The Legend of Zelda : A Link Between WorldsI played most of this game laying in bed waiting for one kid or another to wake up. It was a salve for the tension of not really sleeping a full night for a few years straight. Aside from that personal bit of nostalgia it was just a solid game. It&rsquo;s like they were in the middle of a remake of Link to the Past and decided instead to go in a whole new direction. It feels classic and timeless in all the ways that you would want.&nbsp;Portal 2I played through the entirety of the co-op mode of Portal 2 with my oldest son. He would have been around 4. Sometimes it took a few tries to get through a particularly tricky puzzle that required accurate timing, but we did it. Now he plays Doom Eternal on Nightmare, so that early practice must have stuck.&nbsp;We still sometimes talk about the lemons.Metal Gear Solid V : The Phantom PainI Don&rsquo;t think I have played a single game for as many hours as I did with Metal Gear Solid V. I played every mission. Every mission. Side stuff. Stuff you didn&rsquo;t need to do. Stuff that didn&rsquo;t matter. I ran every one of those missions multiple times. I think it was the freedom. You could literally approach most of the missions in that game from any direction with any equipment. You could sneak, you could shoot, you could use the games systems against it. I didn&rsquo;t think we would ever see such an intricate framework of systems so expertly implemented. I hope there are more games like it.&nbsp;Bloodstained : Ritual of the NightThere have been a lot of games that purported to be the spiritual successor to Castlevania Symphony of the night, but I think only Bloodstained : Ritual of the Night can truly claim that crown. It takes everything in Symphony and extends it, expands it, reworks it into a fully modern game that plays like you remember Symphony playing like without just aping a game that came out on the first playstation.Mass Effect 2 and 3The first Mass Effect game came out in 2007 and I won the 360 version of it in a giveaway at a microsoft game developers meetup sometime early in 2008. I don&rsquo;t think that I actually had a 360 to play it on until sometime in 2009. It is possible that I played that entire series this past decade, but I don&rsquo;t really remember. Still, if I could only include the second and third entry of the Mass Effect series, that would be good enough. Mass Effect kept me up late when I really needed the sleep. There are characters and moments in that series that I will hold with me for as long as I possibly can.Into the BreachThe simplicity and tightness of the game loop for Into the Breach is absolutely stunning. I think the only game that I have come across that is equal to it is Might and Magic: Clash of Heroes, but that was too old to make the list.&nbsp;Titanfall 2The first person shooter is such well worn territory at this point that there aren&rsquo;t many that can surprise me. Titanfall 2 is endlessly inventive and no mechanic ever overstays its welcome. It&rsquo;s the sort of game that I can see myself replaying every now and then and wondering why no one makes &lsquo;em like that anymore.Dark SoulsI started Dark Souls a few times before I figured out what it was. I had to go back and play Demon&rsquo;s Souls first before I got it. Dark Souls is a video game ass video game. It is what the makers of old NES side scrolling platformers would have made if they were suddenly gifted modern computer hardware and software tools. It is a modern game with a very old design attitude. I should probably go finish Dark Souls 3. I have a character stuck somewhere in the first third of that game.Super Mario OdysseyMost games frontload all of the good stuff. In the first few hours you will have seen everything the developers had in them. You will then spend the remaining hours of the game doing those same tasks over and over. For some games that&rsquo;s enough. Others will start to drag. Super Mario Odyssey just keeps getting better and more fun the deeper you go. Every level is new and different. Very few games are so full of joy.Super Mario 3D WorldI came to this game late. It had been out for a few years before we got it, and I didn&rsquo;t play it for probably another year more. When I did play it I didn&rsquo;t want to put it down. Mario games have never been the sort that gives you that &ldquo;one more level&rdquo; feeling, but this one absolutely does. I really hope they make another.Beat SaberAny time we show someone VR, Beat Saber is one of the first games that we load up. It is a game that could not exist without VR. It just wouldn&rsquo;t work. It&rsquo;s more fun than pretty much any other rhythm game I have played and it&rsquo;s simple enough that everyone gets what to do by their second or third attempt. It&rsquo;s one of the only &lsquo;must play&rsquo; VR experiences.Dishonored and Dishonored 2They went and made a world so beautifully ugly that I want to walk around in it. I want to be there, in that space. I want to be in Dunwall smelling the rot and feeling the roof shingles. The magical ninja power fantasy is one of the best in any game, but I think it is the setting that really makes me love the Dishonored series.&nbsp;The Outer WildsThe Outer Wilds is like a magic trick. It gets you looking in one direction while it is gradually unravelling a beautiful, tragic, exultant tale right under your nose. When you suddenly see the clockwork perfection of it, it&rsquo;s staggering. The fate of an entire universe all woven together through little snippets of investigation and evidence gathering. I don&rsquo;t know that I have ever played a game so filled with pleasant melancholy. The Outer Wilds is one of the best games I have ever played. Ever.I&rsquo;ll end it there. I could go on, and there are a few games that I cut from the list. None of them were bad, and at least a few would be someone else's favorite of the decade. Like I said, this isn&rsquo;t a ranked list, just some Best Games I look forward to writing about in the future.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThere is a lot of amazing music in games. From the early 8bit days until now some of the best music written on this planet has been written in the service of games. The particular repetitive nature of game music has made it memorable both by circumstance and design. We have roughly 50 years worth of game music available to us. It would be pretty easy to argue that only since the 8bit era has game music been really great. Let's call it 35 years. Since the NES and the 8bit computers, music for games has been increasingly spectacular. From the bouncy notes of Super Mario Bros. to the choral soundscapes of Halo to the surging metal power of Doom Eternal, music is an integral part of the video game experience. So why then do almost no game soundtracks have lyrics?I was thinking about this recently. There are only a few successful examples of game music that include singing. There are lots with choral vocalizations, but only a handful of game soundtracks actually use music with lyrics. I think I might know why, but here is a bit of rambling exploration of that thought.For quite a long time, the only way to get music out of a video game was to synthesize it. Computer memory limits meant that storing or playing back digitally recorded music was simply impossible. When it was no longer impossible, it was outlandishly expensive. When it was finally cheap enough, the technology wasn&rsquo;t really in place to make it work.&nbsp;Eventually, the CDROM disc emerged as the standard for storing and distributing video games. Before that, the only reasonable way to store music was to encode it as a sequence that could be played back in realtime by a synthesizer chip. This led to a lot of game soundtracks having very distinct sound signatures depending on the particular synth chip being used. NES music sounds different from C64 music which sounds different from Sega Genesis music. In concept these synth soundtracks are more like reading sheet music and playing it through a particular instrument than like playing back a recording of a performance. The distinctiveness of each tune helped to make older game music memorable. The music to Super Mario Bros. only sounds like that when it comes out of a real NES. Or at least it did until fairly recently.&nbsp;Old video game cartridges and diskettes are very cramped spaces. Music had to fight for room alongside graphics and code so storing hours of a full orchestral arrangement was absolutely out of the realm of possibility. This meant that a lot of older game soundtracks had to be very tightly looped. Short segments of music playing again and again and again while the player attempts to defeat a given stage. Bad music became grating very quickly. Good music burrowed itself inside your head and wrapped around your nostalgia centers waiting to be reactivated with the remembrance of a few notes.&nbsp;There is some wonderful music scattered throughout the 8 and 16 bit eras, but none of it has lyrics. By the time it was possible to weave a soundtrack containing recorded vocal performances into a video game, the pattern of short catchy loops with occasional changups and stings had become the established style. This sort of music worked for games and the gameplay fed into the music. Habits and expectations are tough to break.Of course there is also the timing problem. While a music loop can be played over and over indefinitely, a song with verse and chorus sort of has a built in running length. Hearing someone sing the same thing many times in a row can get monotonous quickly. Making sure that a particular section of your game can be played through by a majority of the players in a certain span of time without putting the experience on rails sounds incredibly difficult. If you want the music to rise just as a player is doing something very cool, using a pre-recorded song might not cut it.Since the advent of the CDROM there have been a lot of examples of games trying to incorporate music with lyrics with varying degrees of success. Here are a few of the better examples and why I think they worked.The Metal Gear solid franchise has had some incredible music. Some of that music features great vocal performances. They hit at just the right times for maximum impact, but they almost always do it at the expense of game control. The sequence containing the track will be on rails or pre timed to match with the music.The Microwave hall in Metal Gear 4:Guns of the Patriotshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdjLBYxAcUI&amp;ab_channel=hexen2k7Matches an operatic piece with a gut wrenching gameplay sequence, but it is entirely scripted and timed out. There isn&rsquo;t much that the player can do to change the pace of this segment.Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain includes the song Sins of the Fatherhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q-8syq9F74&amp;ab_channel=KefkaProductionWhere the scene is again, preplanned and largely out of the players control.Sonic Adventure 2 Sort of kicks off with a banger Escape From the Cityhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WcyVvWZJU4&amp;ab_channel=DeoxysPrimeThe song is on loop but there is enough here for most players to only hear it a couple of times during the level. The song isn&rsquo;t around long enough to overstay its welcome, but it adds some punch to an already fast and fun area of the game.&nbsp;Super Mario Odyssey&rsquo;s jazzy&nbsp; Jump Up, Super Star!&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjVFfjg8dds&amp;t=0shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1IHvzwUd6w&amp;ab_channel=AFGuidesHDLikewise plays on loop, but the area has been timed out pretty tightly so you are unlikely to hear the 4 or so minute song more than once. When you do reach the end, you can listen to it again for as long as you want.Also in Super Mario Odyssey, sounding like a lost The Bangles song Honeylune Ridge:Escape&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjVFfjg8dds&amp;t=7427sLoops but doesn&rsquo;t wear on the player due to how tightly timed the underlying level is.Then you have Supergiant Games. Every one of their games include songs with lyrics that kick off and accentuate gameplay, but the reason these work is a little different.&nbsp;From Supergiants first game, Bastion, a folk song that is heard as two solos during the game comes together as a duet in the finale.&nbsp;https://youtu.be/9JvNhc13oKI?t=39https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g60bPpXEq9Q&amp;ab_channel=SupergiantGamesThis song isn&rsquo;t a soundtrack to the game, it exists in world and characters can be found singing it. When you come across them it is extremely moving as the words have meaning in the world of the game, and it makes sense for the characters to be singing them. The songs not only feed into the story, but having them repeat makes perfect sense in a folk song tradition. These are characters Idly singing the songs of their respective cultures, that happen to be part of a fractured whole. In one sequence the player is under no threat, and in the other you can do nothing but walk forward.Good Riddance from Hades is great for setting mood and is primarily sung by two characters, also in world.&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yco-B4BSaj4&amp;ab_channel=SupergiantGamesAgain when the song plays, there will be no pressure on the player so focussing on the lyrics and the meaning behind them is possible.We All Become from Transistorhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9O2Rjn1azc&amp;ab_channel=SupergiantGamesThere are a couple of great songs with lyrics in this game about a singer. In the world of the game these are her songs. They feel connected and natural. They are also largely played during sequences when you have limited or no control over the character so timing isn&rsquo;t much of an issue.&nbsp;Controlhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ods12uljo6w&amp;ab_channel=CerebralTigerThis sequence has it all. A long but looping song, segments of action gameplay, segments of very linear movement, and timed progression. They also adjust the playback of the song on the fly so that the parts that need to rise and fall during the sequence can do so dynamically. When they want you to feel like an awesome, powerful superhero, metal music and growly vocals kick in at just the right moments. This might honestly be the current high water mark for using music with lyrics in a game, during gameplay, to reinforce gameplay.Here is the Director of Control talking about how the sequence was accomplished.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJsXZhSsaUk&amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;ab_channel=NoclipSo it seems like if you want to have lyrics in your game music, and you don&rsquo;t want it to be jarring, you have to either have to run it over a cut scene or a limited interaction sequence, time it out impeccably and don&rsquo;t be concerned with possible looping, or do what Remedy did with Control and layer every part of that sequence in a way that you can dial it up and down dynamically. Music playback technology has come far enough that it is possible to sequence pre-recorded vocals and music just like they did on the synth chips of the 8 bit era. That last option seems the most difficult to pull off, but now that a few game creators have proved that it is possible maybe we will hear a lot more music with lyrics in future games.&nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Batman: The Video GameLook at this. Just look at it.         Okay. You seen that. Now look at this.         Did you take that in. Did you count how many colors are on screen. I did. The first screenshot has 8. There are 8 colors on the screen there. The second jumps it up all the way to 12. 12 colors. I suppose it&rsquo;s technically 13 since one of the values in the foreground elements is transparent. The rest of the game proceeds the same way.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m no expert on the capabilities of the Nintendo Entertainment System, but from what I can gather it would have been possible to have around 24 colors on screen at any one time. 25 if you're feeling squirrely. It might have even been possible to display more colors with some trickery, anywhere from the low 50&rsquo;s all the way up to 256. Most devs at the time could assemble a solid palette of 24 colors from a preselected range of 64. Not great, but not too shabby.&nbsp;When Sunsoft created Batman: The Video Game they looked at all of those available colors and just said &lsquo;Nah, 12 and one transparent value is fine&rdquo;. They were right.More striking than the extremely limited palette is the use of black. The overwhelming majority of every frame this game draws to the screen is black. Background tiles blend away naturally. Shadows are so deep they swallow up everything leaving only the faintest hints of distant Gotham lights. It&rsquo;s a bold choice. It feels very Batman.There were a lot of games around the time that Batman came out that used very limited color palettes and spare background graphics. The NES, after all, was not a powerful machine even by the standards of the day. Most graphically constrained games on the hardware seem like compromises. For Batman, it seems like a choice.&nbsp;I realize that I haven&rsquo;t really talked about the gameplay. The game plays great. Extremely precise, extremely difficult. It&rsquo;s not a hectic game. Every movement, every jump, every batarang toss, is demanding and calculated. In that way the game also plays like Batman. Every button press has to be considered, accurate, and timed perfectly. I know that I finished the game at one point, but I don&rsquo;t think I ever made it past the 4th level without cheats. Games used to be really really hard.&nbsp;I think that Batman: The Video Game is one of the best examples of a limitation being turned into an asset. The game remains as beautiful today as when it came out, and I doubt anyone would ever notice that the color palette is so limited.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a great game, but even based on looks alone, Batman: The Video Game is one of the best games.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWhen you are expecting a new baby everyone is keen to tell you about all of the firsts. There will be a first poop. A first step. A first fall. A first full night sleep. A first real laugh. A first word. A first illness. A first solid meal. A first sentence. A first day of school.There are so many firsts to anticipate. So many firsts that seem so important. So many that you try to record or inscribe to memory.&nbsp;Most of them will be quickly lost amidst a flood of seconds and thirds and so on. Some you will regret losing to time, some will be better lost. Some will burn so deep in you that you will recall them perfectly and often for years after.What people never tell you is all the lasts.There will be a last diaper. A last toddlers tantrum. There will be a last breastfeed. A last daytime nap.Lasts are usually things you are glad are over. I think this is why people don&rsquo;t mention them. That last diaper is a real relief and something to look forward to, but you won&rsquo;t remember it.Every night before bed I would read to my kids. There was probably a first bedtime story for us, but I don&rsquo;t remember what it was.&nbsp;The last was only a few months ago. That was a last that will stick with me.They like to read on their own now. At night or whenever. I understand it and appreciate it, but I don&rsquo;t have to like it.&nbsp;Over the years we went from reading picture books and small short stories to entire series of novels. I didn&rsquo;t keep count but I know that I have read, out loud, at least 50 novels to my kids.Some of them I did voices for the different characters. Some I didn&rsquo;t. Some were so dull I would tune out and think about something else while I said the words on the page. Some I had to fight back tears to read certain scenes. During some of them, everyone was fighting back tears. Doing that every night. Reading stories out loud. That&rsquo;s the sort of thing that wears a groove into your heart.&nbsp;Giving that up, giving up reading to them wasn&rsquo;t something I wanted to do. Of course there are lasts. I knew that this would be one of them. I knew it, but I don&rsquo;t have to like it.&nbsp;I know that when the next book in the Kingkiller Chronicle series comes out, I will likely read it on my own, as will they. We will be able to talk about it and discuss it and share it in the way that adults and young adults typically share stories, but I probably won&rsquo;t read it out loud to them. That stings a little. But for them and for me I know it&rsquo;s okay. Things change and just as there are firsts, there are lasts. As long as everyone is safe and healthy, lasts are something we all just need to accept. I know it&rsquo;s more difficult for me than it is for them.Don&rsquo;t be too surprised if I start reading some of these posts and recording them. I&rsquo;ll just call it therapy.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - KaratekaFighting games are all about range and timing. You press the kick button of this side of the screen and a few milliseconds later your character has their leg extended reaching for the unguarded midsection of your opponent. Let that kick fly from too far a distance and the game's hidden collision boxes strike nothing. Too close and your opponent can intercept with a shorter range, but slightly quicker attack of their own. Range and timing.&nbsp;Karateka is probably best known as one of the first, if not the first, cinematic games. Jordan Mechner was a college student studying film when he developed Karateka. The game wears those film school influences proudly. Musical stings. Cuts to establishing and framing shots. Presenting your progress through the stages with wordless camera movements rather than scripted story dumps. Fluid rotoscope style character animation. It all works to propel you through the game, but I don&rsquo;t want to talk about any of that.It is amazing to me how successful Karateka is as a fighting game.&nbsp;Karate Champ is typically thought of as the first arcade fighting game. It is a twin stick game where you can use fairly complex inputs to manipulate the would-be Karate Champ. You can engage in martial combat against a computer opponent or against another person.&nbsp;While firing off attacks in Karate Champ isn&rsquo;t too terribly difficult, actually landing them is. Still, as a first shot in a genre Karate Champ is a decent game. A flawed early step into what would eventually be the last great arcade genre before home consoles overtook location based games.&nbsp;In contrast, Karateka nearly knocks it out of the park.Karateka, Karate Champ, and side scroller beat&rsquo;em up Kung Fu Master, were released the same year so it is pretty much impossible that Jordan Mechner took any inspiration from them, or any other fighting game for that matter. Karateka is a fully formed singular creation. Punch and kick fighting was just in the early 80&rsquo;s air. Even with that &lsquo;first game in a genre&rsquo; deficit&nbsp; Karateka manages to nail the fighting game formula. It&rsquo;s all about range and timing.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s true that Karateka offers no player vs. player mode, but in the game&rsquo;s defence, it was programmed on an Apple II. Not a real powerhouse of computer hardware, even at the time. The best that could be accomplished was pitting the player against one solitary computer enemy at a time. It does help that this limitation plays into all the Kung Fu and Karate movie tropes of a lone warrior defeating a cadre of villains singlehanded. Only Karateka seems to be set in a world where no one ever learned to turn around.&nbsp;The fighting system itself does seem like it would probably work in a player vs player mode, as evidenced by this patch to the game that lets a second person play as the enemies ( https://archive.org/details/karateka-two-player ).Karateka is a smooth and deliberate game. You will quickly learn over the first handful of enemies that you can&rsquo;t mash on the attack button and hope to win. You need to wait for your enemy to overextend themselves before you dive in to deliver a kick or series of quick punches. The whole game is range and timing. You can keep yourself a hair out of their range, rocking back and forth in a crossover step just waiting for enemy goons to slip up and launch a kick at the air where your head used to be. And if things are getting too hot and your health is dwindling you can retreat a few steps.Jordan Mechner recounts in the journals he kept while making Karateka how he thought games needed to have two different but overlapping goals. In Karateka you need to balance the&nbsp;fights&nbsp;against individual enemies with the total ground you have to cover. You will need to start at the edge of a cliff and fight all the way through a fortress&nbsp;in order to battle the final enemy, Akuma. If you retreat more than you advance during a fight you won&rsquo;t reach the next checkpoint before a fresh guard appears. Retreat too far, and you fall off the cliff.&nbsp;The faster you close the distance between you and Akuma, the fewer guards&nbsp;you will have to deal with. Some of the later fights can be very tough so you won&rsquo;t want to retreat much if you can help it. Even the meta game of Karateka hinges on range and timing. It is a fighting game to its core.Karateka might be one of the earliest fighting games, but it&rsquo;s also one of the best games.&nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Metal Gear Solid VImagine you are in a forest. It&rsquo;s a pleasant day. You hear birds chirping in the treetops above you. Enough shade to be cool, enough sunlight to be warm. There is a shallow creek in your path that you would like to cross. What do you do?You could simply walk through the water counting on the heat of the day to dry out your shoes and socks. You could toss enough fist sized stones into the water to create a makeshift bridge. You could fell a nearby tree to span the creek. You could scrounge through the forest for enough deadfall to create a pathway over the water. You could walk until you found a path around the water, assuming it pooled at some point. You could leave and come back tomorrow with a truck or a bulldozer and bend the earth to your wants.&nbsp;Any of these are possible because this is a real world situation that involves real world interactions. In the real world there are more options than there are constraints. Sometimes there are so many options that it seems like none of them are viable. Unlimited interactions, unlimited choice, unlimited solutions to unlimited problems.Videogames are not like the real world. Videogames are extremely limited sets of systems that play off of one another. Pac-Man eats dots, ghosts eat Pac-Man, Pac-Man eats big dot, Pac-Man eats ghosts. Repeat. This limited interaction space is one of the things that makes videogames fun. When a player can explore the boundaries of the play experience quickly they can also attempt to optimize for better solutions quickly. Optimizing for better solutions to seemingly random problems is something that humans find fun, so getting there quickly is often a good thing.What if, instead of creating a small interaction space to get to &lsquo;fun&rsquo; quickly, you went huge. Like ridiculously huge. What if you layered systems on top of systems on top of systems and created so many potential solutions that it would be difficult to untangle them all or to determine which ones are viable. While you would never be able to create so many possible interactions that it rivaled the real world, what if you made a videogame that gave you a taste of that real world interaction space. Just enough to trick your brain into thinking that anything you attempt might be possible. What if enough of those attempts actually did turn out to be possible, not because they were specifically designed to be possible, but because there was no restriction against whatever weird garbage you tried. Now you have a different sort of fun. The type where you aren&rsquo;t compelled to optimize, but to experiment. To improvise. To see how far you can push the simulation before you break it. To push the simulation with the intention of breaking it.Pac-Man is a fun game. It&rsquo;s fun for about 15 to 20 minutes. That&rsquo;s enough time for a couple games usually. Maybe you play really well and you manage to extend one game for that entire 20 minutes. You leave the game satisfied and you can probably go back and play again in a day or two for another 20 minutes. That&rsquo;s great. It&rsquo;s a great way to design a game.Metal Gear Solid V is the other type of game. It&rsquo;s a game that you explore and experiment with. It&rsquo;s a collection of systems so deep that you can run the same mission countless times (and you will) without ever exhausting the potential solution space. You can improvise or plan, use the systems or rail against them. You can play it whatever way you want for 100 hours and still never see every possible interaction.&nbsp;Is Metal Gear Solid V the best game in the Metal Gear series? Yes. And No. I suppose it depends who you ask and when.&nbsp;Is Metal Gear Solid V one of the best games? Absolutely.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\t&#8203;I have had a 3D printer for about 5 years. This is it.         Right from the hop this thing never worked right. Turns out, after running the thing through all sorts of tests, the board that came with it had a counterfeit chip. Oh sure it could move around and print plastic bits, but it never really worked the way it was supposed to. I have had to recalibrate it several times and each time it would run well for months and then suddenly screw up a batch of prints. Then it would be time to recalibrate it again.&#8203;I mean look at this thing.         Honestly I would probably have let it go on like that. I mean it works well enough for what I use it for. Then about a month ago I spun it back up and it had no end of issues. Every print came out awful.Eventually I figured out that this new problem wasn&rsquo;t with the board at all, but the actual print hardware. The tube that the plastic ran through on the way to the heater was cracked. I figured If I needed some new hardware to get it working again, I should probably swap out that bad board at the same time.&nbsp;Here is the new board.         The only problem is that the new board and the old board are nothing alike and I can&rsquo;t mount the new one where the old one sat. So I had to make one of these.         &#8203;There are all sorts of cases and enclosures for this new type of board, so I could have used one of those but really all I needed was something to keep the board up off the table and stable so I designed and printed (on my limp along printer) this base. In addition to that I made a stand for the new screen and control panel.                I&rsquo;ll probably put these up on thingiverse in case anyone else is like me and only needs the bare minimum to hold these boards in place.&nbsp;At present it&rsquo;s about 80% of the way back to working. Here&rsquo;s hoping it prints better and more consistently now.&nbsp;\t\t"

It&rsquo;s easy to use, convenient, and it autosaves to a server somewhere that I can access through whatever device I happen to have available. I type most of these on a computer but I have written them on phones and tablets. For whatever reason, I didn&rsquo;t think that Google Docs was what I needed for more long term writing.I have tried using a lot of open source and commercial writing apps and none of them really did what I needed. Most recently I have been using Wavemaker. In fact almost everything over there was written using Wavemaker. It works well. It&rsquo;s multiplatform and it works on mobile devices, but it is just a little bit too fiddly for my purposes. I like it, I just don&rsquo;t think I need it.So in the last few days I have taken all my pages, my notes, my character bios, my outlines and backstory, and moved it all over to Google Docs. I use the outliner panel to break up chapters and scenes and I have everything else split up into different docs in a directory. Right now it feels fairly organized. I will probably clutter it all up soon enough, but for now it&rsquo;s everything I need to keep writing without all of the &ldquo;writing tools&rdquo; that I never use.&nbsp;Eventually I will stitch enough of the holes together so that I can start posting up chapters again, but until then I can at least feel comfortable writing and editing with whatever device I happen to have close at hand. Writing 3 sentences on my phone is better than not writing at all because I don&rsquo;t have my laptop nearby or I don&rsquo;t have my files synced up.&nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Star Wars - The Empire Strikes BackAction video games are all about feel. The feel of connection between your fingertips and flickering pools of light on a screen. Get that feel wrong and it won&rsquo;t matter how clever your mechanics are or how inventive your puzzles or how engaging your story, no one will want to play it. Get that feel right and it won&rsquo;t matter that every other aspect of the game comes up short.Star Wars - The Empire Strikes back on the Atari 2600 is Star Wars as imagined by Mondrian. Large flat blocks of color with a palette counted in single digits. It is a representation of the battle of Hoth in abstract. Imperial walkers look more like paper cutouts pasted in a shoebox diorama. The hero snow speeder is a rectangle with one bit jutting out the side. Sound effects are tinny digital farts and bloops. Even with all that simplification, the game feels like the battle of Hoth. It&rsquo;s all here, just compacted down to the thinnest of essentials.This game works, because it feels right. Your snow speeder can whip along at a staggering pace, but it can also stop and reverse direction with shocking agility. There is a slight drift to all of your movements that presents a sense of weight, but doesn&rsquo;t feel out of control. The horizontal flight of the ship is incredibly smooth for the Atari 2600, a system not really known for its smoothness. The walkers are menacing and durable, but not indestructible. The odds are stacked against you, but there is at least a feeling of hope.The truth is, there is no hope. This is a game, like the movie sequence it represents, where the good guys will lose. You will either see all of your ships destroyed by blaster fire or the inevitable march of Imperial walkers will overrun your base. Those are the only two ways this game ends. Surprising enough this only adds to the game&rsquo;s feel. Letting the player change the fictional history of the battle would just feel wrong I suppose.The game is simple, spare even, but it feels great to play. Smooth and fun and correct under your fingertips. More than the setting, more than the visuals, more than the mechanics, this is what matters. When a game feels right, it plays right.&nbsp;This is why Star Wars - The Empire Strikes Back is one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI have played two games recently that only exist because of the terrible power of nostalgia. Ah nostalgia, come to bite us again have you?I&rsquo;m glad these games exist because they are both good, but nostalgia did them no favours in a couple of different ways. I&rsquo;ll get to that. First, the requisite old man recap.Side scrolling brawlers, or beat &lsquo;em up&rsquo;s, were extremely popular in arcades during the mid to late 80&rsquo;s. It was a genre that served both the player and the arcade owner so it is no real surprise that they became so dominant. For the player, they initially provide a lot of variety and action. You can usually play them cooperatively with a friend and, at least for the first few areas, you can play for quite a while on a single quarter. As the game wears on though they often become quite difficult and that means, if you want to continue, more quarters dropped. More profit for the owner of the arcade machine. The success of the brawler genre was almost assured.As home consoles became more capable, creating ports of the best arcade hits was just smart business. And so, beat &lsquo;em up&rsquo;s like kung fu master, double dragon, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Final Fight made their way to living room tv&rsquo;s. Never underestimate the video game industries ability to sell the same thing to the same people over and over and over again.It wasn&rsquo;t long before developers started making original games in the genre specifically for consoles. Almost 30 years ago Streets of Rage came out for the Sega Genesis and Battletoads made its debut on the NES. Equally coincidental, both series have received brand new entries this year. Coincidental, or nostalgia runs on a very specific time cycle.I played through Streets of Rage 4 and I am most of the way through Battletoads. Both of these games are side scrolling brawlers, now a largely dead genre. Both of these games are slavish to this largely dead genre, but suffer for that in different ways. I think one of these games is much better than the other. Nostalgia has ways of muddying which one that is. I suppose it&rsquo;s worth noting that I played neither of these series much and have no particular affinity to either. I just like games where you can punch stuff.As I was playing Streets of Rage I found that I enjoyed the visual design and the music, I felt the game played fairly well and seemed very much &ldquo;one of those&rdquo;. A Beat &lsquo;em up. A good beat &lsquo;em up, but it did nothing particularly interesting either. All in all a fun couple of hours. But there is a reason this is a mostly dead genre.The beat &lsquo;em up works well for the arcade. It&rsquo;s fast, kinetic, easy to pick up, and short. All things that players and arcade owners want. When you have the game at home, with no risk of spending any extra quarters, the design and play cycle is a tad on the simplistic side. 30 years later this continues to be true.Battletoads on the other hand attempts to mix up the regular button mashy punching with all sorts of puzzles, mini-games, and comedic diversions. The previous Battletoads games contained sudden, radical difficulty spikes, so of course this one does too. Thankfully they took a more modern approach to these spikes and pretty much let you brute force them by never really punishing you for failure. As a result it ends up being a much better, more modern, game than Streets of Rage 4. Problem is, nostalgia is a real kick in the head.The Streets of Rage series, in its time, was much more highly regarded than Battletoads. Streets of Rage simply looked, sounded, and played better back when both game series were still young. If you look up reviews for the recent versions you will see a marked trend where reviewers heap praise on Streets of Rage 4 and are mostly lukewarm on Battletoads. Completely inverted from how I would evaluate them, but exactly as I would expect, nostalgia being what it is.So nostalgia created these new games, nostalgia kept them stuck in old, mostly abandoned conventions, and nostalgia distorted the public perception of them when they were done.&nbsp;Maybe it&rsquo;s time for everyone to admit that nostalgia really does this art form no favours and maybe, if we just frame past works as they really were rather than chasing how they made us feel, we could better appreciate the past, present, and future of this medium.But we won&rsquo;t. And I would absolutely play a new Legendary Wings game.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - TrackmaniaYou could learn how to race a car. You could study every minuscule technical detail that makes one car perform better than another. You could master aerodynamics and the physics of rubber on asphalt. You could steel your will and steady your hand when contending with other vehicles and drivers traveling down the same track at high speed. You could simulate all of this in a racing game.Or you could do none of that and play Trackmania.You pilot a car, yes, around a track, yes, but Trackmania is nothing like Forza or Gran Turismo. Trackmania is not like car racing.&nbsp;Trackmania is filled with impossible tracks that you careen down as fast as you possibly can. There are other vehicles on the track but they are intangible and you will have no interaction with them besides watching the path that they drive. There are special interactive zones on the track that will speed up or slow down your car. Some will cut your engine forcing you to glide the remainder of your race so you best have your speed up before you hit them. Solving this puzzle of speed and angles, drift and airtime, that&rsquo;s what Trackmania is.You can play it with the four arrow keys on your keyboard. That might be the best way to play Trackmania.&nbsp;There have been about 150 different Trackmania games. Don&rsquo;t let that fool you. They are all the same game. They are all a perfect distillation of speed, reaction, and anticipation. They are all perfect games.Trackmania is one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThis past weekend I participated in the Alberta Game Jam. Game creators from all over the province convened over Discord to put on this remote version of the game jam. While I usually find the fun of a game jam is working with a team, I opted to attempt this one solo. It wasn&rsquo;t very successful.The past two times I did a solo jam it was so that I could try something different. I wrote a random text adventure that you couldn&rsquo;t win and made a single pixel at a time drawing program with no instructions.&nbsp;Both times I was working with tools I wasn&rsquo;t very familiar with and using it as an excuse to mess around. This time was very similar. There were a few things that I wanted to test out using tools that I am fairly familiar with but never have the opportunity to try. Some of those things worked, but even more of them didn&rsquo;t.In the end I wound up making the beginnings of a 2d platformer. I had even intended to use a readily available character controller script but when that didn&rsquo;t pan out like I had hoped I ended up writing my own. It&rsquo;s not perfect but it has most of the features I wanted to add and it would be fairly simple to reuse or extend it in the future.&nbsp;I tried a bunch of stuff with shaders and some of that worked and some of it didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;In the end I didn&rsquo;t make much of a game, but I did learn a few things and I now have all the basics for a simple 2d character controller. So that&rsquo;s not nothing I guess.&nbsp;&#8203;I wouldn't recommend&nbsp;it but if you want to poke at the thing I made it's over here.&#8203;https://eturnip.itch.io/after-the-storm\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI sort of want to talk about machine learning and intelligence.&nbsp;I spent a bunch of time over the last few weeks messing around with Unity&rsquo;s machine learning tools. I won&rsquo;t be putting together any kind of tutorial or forwarding any real actionable info here, because honestly I don&rsquo;t think I am in any position to offer any. I have a better idea how ML works and what sort of problems it seems to be good at, but I think that there are some very harsh limits to what machine learning is capable of. I also think that there are a lot of people out there who are quick to overlook those limits. There is this commonly held belief that machine learning will be the thing that makes computers smarter than humans. Let me tell you, Skynet, this ain&rsquo;t.&nbsp;If you aren&rsquo;t familiar, machine learning or neural net computing or tensorflow ai or evolutionary algorithms, or any of a million other names, are ways of getting a computer to solve problems by iteratively teaching itself. Rather than getting a programmer to study the problem and come up with a generalized solution, machine learning is a method of showing the system the problem, giving it a desired goal, or goals, and then leaving the actual problem solving up to the software. It just sort of fumbles forward until it comes up with a solution that gets to the goal in as efficient a way as it can. It might not be the best solution, but it will be fairly efficient and all it will have cost is computer time.&nbsp;If they were to read that last paragraph there would, no doubt, be a bunch of machine learning researchers tripping over themselves to tell me what I got wrong. There would also be another gang of researchers behind them eager to point out what the first group got wrong. It seems to be that sort of field. Everyone is pretty sure that it&rsquo;s great, but none of them really know how it works. When they tell you they know how it works they are usually wrong. What they probably won&rsquo;t say is that machine learning solutions are &lsquo;smarter&rsquo; than humans.Let me rephrase some of&nbsp; that. They know how machine learning works, like technically how it functions. Maybe it would be better to say that they disagree on how to make it work. Or how to make it work well. Those are really just nuances. Academic inconsistencies.&nbsp;I used machine learning to teach a marble how to not fall off a track. Not how to get anywhere. Not what anything in their environment is. Nope. Just how to not fall. They don&rsquo;t even avoid the edge of the track very well. They like getting right up beside the edge and not falling off. Many hours of training over a few weeks, and they will try their damndest to not fall off a track. At this point they usually succeed.I made a machine learning agent reproduce a certain behavior that I was looking for in a variety of situations, but I don&rsquo;t know thing one about machine learning. I do know this. It&rsquo;s not smarter than a human.&nbsp;The human brain is a massively parallel, analog, electro-chemical, comparative decision making system that never, ever stops running. Sleeping, still running. Chemically unbalanced, still running. Physically compromised, still running. Nothing short of death stops an animal brain from running. What&rsquo;s more, human societies have developed high density communication systems that transfer information from one individual&rsquo;s brain to another. These communication systems developed over hundreds of thousands of years. The amount of information conveyed in a simple interaction between people is absolutely staggering, but of course we take it for granted, because we are humans and we are uniquely equipped to be able to decipher that much data presented in that specific way. Tone of voice, cadence of speech, flutters of the eyelids, physical gestures of all types. Communication as dense and varied as there are groups of people to engage in them. Nothing in the realm of machine learning systems even comes close.A computer beat several top level players at Go. That doesn&rsquo;t prove that machines are smarter than humans. It proves that humans built a tool. If I use a wrench to turn a nut, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the wrench is better than my hand. It means that people have created a tool that solves the problem of enhancing grip and leverage. Wrenches are crap at shuffling cards. I can&rsquo;t use a wrench to solve a rubik's cube or type this post. It is a tool that enhances human ability. The machine that is good at playing Go is just that. A machine that is good at playing Go, because people wanted to make a tool that was good at playing Go. It can&rsquo;t tell me if the milk in the back of my fridge has gone bad. That would require a different tool. Maybe machine learning could be used to make it. That would not and will not make that machine smarter than the human who wanted to know about the state of their milk.&nbsp;Let me also be clear here, this is not because I think that there is some intangible, fundamental, superiority of humans over the machines they create. Not even close. This is just a matter of time. Human brains run constantly and have run constantly for hundreds of thousands of years. Animal brains for hundreds of millions before that. And those brains don&rsquo;t run slower than computer circuits, just different. All brains have done for over 500 million years, is figure out how to solve problems. You could throw all the Nvidia GTX cards you want into the machine learning arena, they just can&rsquo;t compete with that much iteration time.I think what a lot of folks who tout the idea of a generalized AI that&rsquo;s smarter than people forget is that people created Go. It was people who created a game with such a wide possibility space that they themselves couldn&rsquo;t competently calculate it. They created a problem they couldn&rsquo;t solve and then hammered away on it for a couple thousand years because it was fun.&nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t the sort of species that you just surpass because you built a machine that can do multiplication real good. When it comes to being clever, humans are certifiable badasses. Problem solving, Iteration, intuitive lateral thinking. Really nothing tops us. We&rsquo;ve just been doing it longer.&#8203;\t\t"

Some wail. Some seethe, rending the air about them with arcs of furious power. The wizard sits. The wizard contemplates.

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Saints Row IV&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s get this straight right off the jump. Saints Row: The Third is the best game in the Saints Row series. Volition made two games that could be fairly summed up as Grand Theft Auto clones with toilet humor before reworking the 3rd into a self aware comedy that was as much parody as it was forward looking. Saints Row: The Third raised the bar for what an open world character driven game could be and stood out as a truly wonderful experience all it&rsquo;s own.&nbsp;Then they made Saints Row IV. It would be easy to see this followup game as derivative. After all it did use a lot of the same assets and gameplay loops. The mission structures and events in Saints Row: The Third that seemed fresh and interesting were rehashed with the thinnest layers of polish in the 4th game. All of your favorite old characters were back. But they were old, and they were back. Like from before. Previous.&nbsp;Still Saints Row IV made it here into one of my Best Games posts.With Saints Row IV, Volition chose fun. If there was a decision to make between difficulty and fun they chose fun. If they had to choose between realism and fun they chose fun. If there was an opportunity to prioritize fun over engaging with the systems already in the game, they chose fun.&nbsp;This is a game world full of a variety of fun cars and planes you can steal and roam around in, but your character can run like the flash so that is usually more fun than driving. This is a game with an arsenal ten miles deep and you never need to use it because running up a building and jumping down with the force of a small nuke is more fun. The story is absolute nonsense that straddles the line between The Matrix and Independence Day and it wears all of its influences proudly on its sleeve, but it is fun.&nbsp;If you look back to reviews of the game you will see a lot of folks taking a few points off the game for being too easy. And it is. Saints Row IV is an absolute cakewalk. Past the halfway point there will rarely be anything that pops up that challenges the player in the slightest. And it doesn&rsquo;t matter at all. Sometimes fun is what matters. Sometimes you have to prioritize fun.&nbsp;The characters and their antics are genuinely funny, if a certain level of side eyed lowbrow is something you find funny. The kind of irreverent that is smart enough to know where to land it&rsquo;s punches and when to just be silly. The writing in Saints Row IV prioritizes fun.&nbsp;Saints Row: The Third is a rare beast. An open world comedy action game that refuses to be snide or gritty. There is an upbeat optimism woven into the mayhem. Violence so bizarre and unrealistic that it lends the game a sort of helium filled buoyancy. It was and is a brilliant game.Saints Row IV does that all again but removes any and all barriers to fun. Do what you want. Be what you want. Become an agent of chaos in this simulated world. Just don&rsquo;t worry, the pins will be set back up for you to knock them down all over again and again and again. In any way you like.&nbsp;You know, Fun.Fun is why Saints Row IV is one of the best games&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Dragon&rsquo;s LairWhat if one of the best games is actually a very bad game. I mean that&rsquo;s nonsense right? It can&rsquo;t be both one of the best games and be bad right? It absolutely can if that game is Dragon&rsquo;s Lair.Dragon&rsquo;s Lair was released into arcades in 1983 and it&rsquo;s safe to say that no one had ever seen anything like it. Every other arcade game at the time featured screens filled with blocky pixelated graphics or sharp but simple vector graphics. Pac-Man, Dig Dug, and Mario Bros. were bright and colorful. They were accompanied by memorable bits of music and catchy sound effects. Not one of them looked and sounded like Dragon&rsquo;s Lair. How could they. Dragon&rsquo;s Lair was a fully voiced, orchestrated, and animated production created by Don Bluth&rsquo;s studio. Former Disney animators had worked on this game. All of the movement and life that went into an animated feature film was on display in this stand up arcade machine. No video game had ever looked and sounded like Dragon&rsquo;s Lair.&nbsp;It was the most popular game of it&rsquo;s time, and one of the most popular games of all time. There are three arcade games on permanent display in the Smithsonian and Dragon&rsquo;s Lair is one of them. It also absolutely sucks.The technological beating heart of the Dragon&rsquo;s Lair arcade cabinet was a laserdisc video player. Laserdiscs weren&rsquo;t a new technology in 1983. The format was created more than a decade earlier and enjoyed a limited commercial release during the late 1970&rsquo;s. To oversimplify it, a Laserdisc is like a video record that is read with a laser rather than a physical needle. Because the video is stored on a disc, the laser can move to a new track very quickly and play back a video clip in a blink. Someone at some point noted this fact and wondered if it would be fast enough to react to a person&rsquo;s inputs, like a video game.It sort of almost works too.&nbsp;When you play Dragon&rsquo;s Lair it starts playing a video clip of a gangly looking knight walking across a drawbridge. You are told during the attract animation that this is Dirk the Daring and you are leading him in his quest through a wizard&rsquo;s castle to save Princess Daphne from an evil dragon. Pretty standard fare.In an instant, part of the drawbridge collapses and Dirk almost plunges into the monster infested water below. In that sliver of a moment you are able to select from one of five different inputs. Up, down, left, right, or sword. If you do nothing you will be pulled down by the monster. If you attempt to move in any direction you will be pulled down by the monster. If you use the sword and then push up on the joystick you will succeed and Dirk will move on to the next scene. There is no nuance, zero room for error. You enter the correct inputs within the time window available or you watch Dirk succumb to one of many grisly ends.What you are really doing when you enter inputs into a Dragon&rsquo;s Lair cabinet is selecting what video clip will play next. Most inputs are accompanied by a slight pause in the video while the Laserdisc player&rsquo;s read head is seeking for the appropriate clip. Since the outcomes of each scene are predetermined and had been hand animated, painted, and transferred to that Laserdisc months earlier, all of the clips are laid out in such a way to minimize those seek times. It is hard to imagine that anyone was ever convinced that they were actually in control of Dirk&rsquo;s movements. You were absolutely at the helm of the world&rsquo;s quickest (at the time) fast forward and rewind buttons.The animation on display is absolutely top quality, but as a game experience Dragon&rsquo;s Lair is terrible. There is only a tenuous connection between what you are doing with the controls and what happens on screen. The game often requires inputs that would be impossible to decipher in a time window that borders on prescience. While some of the scenes provide flashing hints toward your next action the only real way through a lot of the scenes is by trial and error. When you break it down there really isn&rsquo;t much &lsquo;game&rsquo; to this game. No decisions to make, no puzzles to solve, no emergent behaviors to react to. Nothing gamelike at all. You tap out the predetermined inputs to watch a video.But.Dragon&rsquo;s Lair did something to video games. Something important. Dragon&rsquo;s Lair was the push. Every game released through the rest of the 80s and 90s would be compared to Dragon&rsquo;s Lair.That game is great, but it doesn&rsquo;t look like Dragon&rsquo;s Lair.That game is great, but it doesn&rsquo;t sound like Dragon&rsquo;s Lair.That game is great, but the animation isn&rsquo;t as good as Dragon&rsquo;s Lair.This was the game that set the impossible standard. A standard that even it didn&rsquo;t live up to. The standard that would drive game creators to try to make a game that looked as good as Dragon&rsquo;s Lair but actually played as well as you hoped it would when you stepped up to the cabinet.&nbsp;We have hit that point now. Many times. Games with fluid, responsive animation that looks and plays beautifully. Fully voiced and orchestrated games that sound at least as good as their non-interactive film counterparts. Games with life and energy and dazzling visual effects. Games that make good on the promise that Dragon&rsquo;s Lair offered.So why is Dragon&rsquo;s Lair one of the best games? It set the standard in presentation for decades and influenced countless creators. It was a bar to leap over, a record to break. Had it been a film or a saturday morning cartoon, game creators would have paid little to no attention to it. But it wasn&rsquo;t. It was a game. And a challenge. People who create, enjoy nothing more than a challenge. From the moment that the first Dragon&rsquo;s Lair cabinet was powered in an arcade it was inevitable that another game would eventually be made that would look as good or better and would play as well as you wished Dragon&rsquo;s Lair did. It was a goal too tempting. A challenge too worth undertaking.&nbsp;Dragon&rsquo;s Lair is a terrible game, but it is absolutely one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI was doing some more quick concept sketches. Here is a breakdown of this newest one.         First off, before anything else, I watched a bunch of professional wrestling. Specifically a lot of 'off the top rope' moves. I was looking for some dynamic reference and watching video is always better than looking at posed still images if you can do that. Peoples bodies do a lot of really strange stuff that no one would ever pose, but it looks great when you capture just the right frames out of a few videos and use those as your reference. With those references and some simple 3D models that I pose, sort of like the traditional artists wooden doll, I assemble a composition, and then draw it.         Now that I have a simple line drawing, I have to turn them into characters. In the case of this game I am working on, the characters are all about costume. So I dress them up. In the process I try to fix some issues I had with the original line drawing.         At this point I have erased a lot of construction lines and random sketches, but there are still a lot of lines that truck all over the place. I could refine them and erase the mess, Ink on another layer, or go straight to painting. I sort of split the difference here and refined a lot of edges, but since I will be painting over it I didn't ink all the lines or make nice clean line work. This is, after all, a concept sketch.&nbsp;         Got some tighter lines in there so I pick a very limited palette and add some color.         Is it done? Maybe, maybe not. The whole purpose of a concept sketch is to illustrate a concept. It's like writing a mission statement or broad outline. It only has to convey to the intended audience (in this case, me) what the finished product might feel like. I know this game is about a bunch of magical weirdos that roll around in balls and fight each other, but what is that exactly? What does that look and feel like? This is what I'm trying to find. Every drawing brings that concept more and more into focus.&nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI&rsquo;ve been working on a game and this is just a quick update on how that is going.I rigged up a control scheme that let me roll a ball around using Unity physics. That part is pretty simple since all of those systems, the physics and the input handling, are built into the engine. Next I set up a camera that would follow the ball. This is also not too difficult since cameras and their basic controls are also built into unity. It only got tricky when I tried to use my physics based control system along with my following camera.I set up the controls in the simplest way I possibly could, which I think is the only way any game feature should get implemented. I took the value sent from the left thumbstick on a standard gamepad and translated that into physics forces on the ball along the horizontal plane. Pretty simple right? I could move the ball around, but only if the camera stayed directly behind the ball. As soon as the camera lagged a little left or right the entire axis of motion would be different from what your brain expected. To fix that I needed to make the input relative to the camera and not the world or the ball object. Less simple, but not much of a problem. Computers are really good at solving math problems as long as you input the problem properly.&nbsp;Now none of this is anything new for games, and it&rsquo;s not even new for me. I knew this would be an issue that would take some tuning right from the start. That&rsquo;s why I prioritized the feel of movement and camera. It was always going to be something that was going to take some work, and I will be adjusting and changing it all through this project no matter what I do. As a result, the first few iterations were not great, but the potential was there with only a few tweaked parameters and a few lines of code.Since then I have tested and adjusted the basic control many many times. It&rsquo;s getting much closer, but I know that I&rsquo;m still not quite done.After basic movement, I needed to create a place to move in. At first that was just a large flat plane with a few boxes sticking out of it. Next it was a sort of hot wheels track snap together set that included curved and straight pieces. After that it was those same track pieces with banked curves and quarter pipe ramps around bowl structures. Now I have surfaces that can curve in any direction and ramps that can kick the ball high up into the air if you hit them with enough speed.I have just barely started dealing with proper collisions between your player controlled ball and other balls in the world, but that is moving along better than I had expected. I am still having issues with gravity not really feeling right, but I tweak and adjust it all the time.Like any large project, I keep breaking it into bite sized chunks that I can wrap my head around and I deal with them one at a time. So far that seems to be working, but I do wish I could get the gravity problem solved sooner rather than later, because I would like to have more people test it with some good feeling gravity. I don&rsquo;t think that is asking too much.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Chrono TriggerDuring the heyday of the SNES, I was playing games on a PC. It&rsquo;s not that I wasn&rsquo;t interested in console games. I would enjoy them given the opportunity. I just rarely had access to any 8 or 16 bit console during the time they were popular. That meant the only games I ever really played on SNES or Genesis were bite sized, single sitting games. Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, the first few stages of Super Mario World, NHL, that sort of thing. I didn&rsquo;t even bother approaching RPGs. I mean, what would be the point? I could rent a system and some games for a weekend, but there is no way I would finish some 40 hour monstrosity in 2 days, and if I tried to rent it again the save would probably be overwritten. It wasn&rsquo;t really a problem though. I had text adventures and D&amp;D gold box games and Star Control 2. Those were meaty enough games for a 1 PC kid.It wasn&rsquo;t until emulation in the late 90&rsquo;s that I ever even saw Chrono Trigger on a screen. I had read about it in magazines and looked at the box in stores, but I never saw or heard it until it was running, dubiously, on a PC.It was amazing. During the late 90&rsquo;s era of &lsquo;tude and grit, Chrono Trigger is a decidedly more complex beast. Fun and fanciful, but also much more nuanced than a lot of other media of the time.During that first playthrough I could detect echoes of Star Control 2. Like that game Chrono Trigger seems, on its surface, so charming and joyous that you are often caught off guard when the narrative would dwell on very dark subject matter. There is a pleasant anime veneer on Chrono Trigger telling you that the game won&rsquo;t ever take itself too seriously, and it doesn&rsquo;t, but then it suddenly swerves into themes of fascizm, genocide, and hopelessness. It doesn&rsquo;t just touch on those themes superficially. It sits in them, lingers on them, and makes sure that you are fully uncomfortable before moving on.&nbsp;The bleakness of the world in Chrono Trigger connects in a much more profound way than any of the grim-dark nonsense that permeated turn of the millenium. Because it is so pleasant, so kind, so vivid, the underlying desperation of its time travelling story can be felt more deeply.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Chrono Trigger is not a slog of a game. Quite the opposite. It is a grand epic adventure that always feels fun to play. Just the simple act of pushing buttons in the overworld and in combat has a brisk joy to it that tells you that it knows it&rsquo;s a game, and that you have come to play. But here, that play will have consequences, maybe not right away, but sometime during the centuries of time hopping, you will have to confront things that you have or haven&rsquo;t done. It&rsquo;s clever and fun and thoughtful in a way that games rarely are.The second time I played all the way through it was when it was rereleased for the DS. Knowing the story and remembering most of the twists, I thought it would be less impactful and more of a fun thing to do on a lunch break. I ended up getting even more engrossed in the sensitivity of the storytelling.&nbsp;The trojan horse of earnest and joyful presentation helped the creators of Chrono Trigger convey what would otherwise be a bleak and overly complex plot. All that, and it&rsquo;s still just plain fun to play.&nbsp;That&rsquo;s why Chrono Trigger is one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThere aren&rsquo;t enough games where you hit things.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll grant you, in something like 60% of all games you direct a character to punch, kick, or spin attack something. The other 40% involve shooting. Punching or shooting, that&rsquo;s it. Those are the video game verbs.What about Tetris you might ask. That&rsquo;s both. Shapes shoot from the top and punch the bottom. It&rsquo;s obvious really.&nbsp;But how often have you just hit something? Head on crashed right into it, on purpose. How often was that impact satisfying. Rarely? That&rsquo;s what I thought.The problem is this. It&rsquo;s really hard to do. A computer can very easily and efficiently detect when two volumes are intersecting. You can register that as an impact. You can then have the computer output a response to that impact. It&rsquo;s feedback, but it isn&rsquo;t often that the two events seem directly connected. You can see the canned animations and you can feel the unconvincing physics. It all feels a little &lsquo;simulated&rsquo;.There are a few games that get close. Crashing cars in burnout is visually impressive and is very satisfying, but you either feel like the impact was light and the response was overly spectacular or the impact was impressive but more of less out of your control. Sometimes colliding in Rocket League feels pretty good, but only sometimes and it seems more of a luck thing than a lined up, planned out hit. Running into the ball (more of a bounce than a hit) always feels pretty good though. I will also say that I am bad at Rocket League and maybe there is some pro tier way to hit in a satisfying way.Flatout, Wreckfest, and other collision focused racing games will have a good feeling impact every once in a while, but more often than not everything just feels a little bit like it&rsquo;s happening underwater.So far I have only really talked about car games, because those are really the only games where devs spend a lot of time polishing the hits. Full body contact sports like Hockey and Football have enjoyed video game re-creations for as long as there have been video games, but I have never experienced a simulated hit that felt anything like actually playing either of those sports.Here is a strange thing about me. In everyday life I could be easily labeled a pacifist. I own that. I have never been in a physical fight that I started, and I have never, ever, sought one out. But, when I play hockey, I like to hit people. Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I don&rsquo;t go out looking to hurt anyone and it&rsquo;s been years since I have actually played full contact hockey, but I like the feeling of running into another person intentionally to push them off the puck. I think maybe it&rsquo;s because when playing hockey everyone is on equal ground and they are trying to do exactly the same thing to me. No one is angry that you ran into them, they expect it, and likewise I&rsquo;m not angry that they ran into me. In fact, it&rsquo;s fun. We have all agreed that in this rink for this hour or so everyone can run into everyone else, while sometimes moving very fast, and that&rsquo;s okay.&nbsp;Video games have a lot of things running into other things, a lot of characters that smash through the world with wild abandon. Very rarely have any of them ever felt as fun as colliding with a real person in real hockey. It might take me awhile, and I might never get there, but that is the feeling I&rsquo;m chasing with the game I&rsquo;m working on. The simple fun of hitting something.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tFor a brief period this week I wasn&rsquo;t able to use my graphics tablet. If you aren&rsquo;t a digital artist I wouldn&rsquo;t blame you for not caring what a graphics tablet is or what it does. They are a very niche tool that very few people need, but for those people that need one it is utterly indispensable.In brief, a graphics tablet is an input device for your computer that looks like a pen and a fancy drawing board. It can detect startlingly precise pressure, tilt, and sometimes even roll information. All this means is, once you get used to it, you can draw or paint as well as you could with a pencil or paintbrush. Graphics tablets won&rsquo;t ever make you a better artist, but they will convey whatever skill you have developed to the computer accurately. So that&rsquo;s nice.&nbsp;The graphics tablet I have now, a huion h610pro is almost 7 years old. I bought it to replace a Wacom intuos 2. The second, and larger, of the two intuos 2 tablets I used&nbsp; for the preceding 12 or so years. Before that I had a Wacom Pen Partner. The pen partner had a drawing surface smaller than a postcard. All together that&rsquo;s something like 22 years I have been using these devices. Even though I still use a mouse quite often, I really can&rsquo;t function without a graphics tablet. I use it to draw, paint, sculpt, move points around, copy files, select stuff, press buttons, and just do generally anything you could do with a mouse.&nbsp;Not having the tablet, even briefly made me think about tools. The computer under this desk can process inputs faster than my nerves can fire. There is an almost zero chance that I could overwhelm it with the speed or subtlety of my own body&rsquo;s movements. I could have pressure sensitive tools attached to the end of each of my fingers and a regular pc should have no trouble conveying that information to a program for sculpting or painting. A standard mouse can detect movement thousands of times per second. A VR headset with inside out tracking can take stock of the world around it, filter for static objects, and watch for controllers or your hands fast enough that your own proprioception can be fooled making you believe you are in another place entirely. And yet, my interface with an art program is holding a stick in my hand and pressing down more or less hard. Essentially the same root technology people used to draw herds of bovines on cave walls 40-60 thousand years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not like I can think of anything better. Humans use tools in ways that are the most efficient for how our hands and arms and eyes work after all. I just think that with all of this input capacity at our disposal we might be able to come up with something that doesn&rsquo;t rely on what we know from the real world and instead describes an entirely digital, virtual, way of working and creating art.But my tablet is working again, so I&rsquo;m going to go use that and stop this hideously binary typing thing.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tAs promised, here is some more drawing.&nbsp;I thought this time I would do a short breakdown on how I put a drawing together. This current set of concept drawings is for a project I'm working. I'm in the part of the process where I try out a few different things to zero in on a style.&#8203;         First I start out with a rough figure sketch. I did a lot of google image searching for \"Parkour Jump\" to find reference. I want these characters to look like they are free floating but in control of their movement, so parkour and other extreme sports seemed like perfect reference. Then I worked on some poses based on that reference in thumbnail sketches and 3D mockups.&nbsp;&#8203;         Next I refine the sketch and flesh it out, but I like to try to maintain some feeling of movement in the character. These characters wear elaborate headgear and flamboyant costumes, so I didn't put any effort into drawing a face. Any mood had to be conveyed in the body.&#8203;         On a new layer I start working out the costume.         Next I sharpen up lines and define edges. I will be leaving the sketchy lines under the color for this one.         I get some color up in there. I still have to go over this character and work out some more details, but I think I now have an idea of who they are and where to take them from here.Most of the time when I am drawing anything, I'm finding out what needs to get added and what needs to change while I'm drawing it. I'm usually surprised at how it turns out, or if it turns out at all.This one is working out okay I think.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Beat SaberI used to go to the arcade a lot. As often as I could. The first ones I went to were filled with distinct and bizarre cabinets with games as fanciful as they were difficult. Every image on a screen had to be drawn there with only a handful of pixels and a tiny array of colors. Any sound was what could be generated by simple monophonic synths and tin can speakers. Every game was a unique and strange experience. Dreamlike. Those soon gave way to brighter, more colorful visuals that grew more defined and representative. Games with real music and voice samples. This time also birthed genres. There were racing games, scrolling shooters, and maze chase games. Some of the games were great, some not so great, but market forces that directed developers to work on the genres that would sell were already taking hold. So the arcades were filled with a lot of Pac-Man clones and Galaga clones. Still enough unique experiences were being made that an arcade goer could find something that suited them.It wouldn&rsquo;t be very long before the arcades were packed wall to wall with 1 on 1 fighting games. Still difficult, but a different sort of difficult. Fighting games require a player to climb a learning curve before they can have fun with them. I love fighting games, but I think they drove a lot of people who had loved Pac-Man and Qbert from the arcade. They simply demanded too much practice from would be casual players.It wasn&rsquo;t long before the fighting games of the arcade made their way to home consoles and every player who didn&rsquo;t want to wait in line at an arcade machine only to be stomped by someone who had simply practiced more, stayed home and played Marvel Vs. Capcom on their own couch with their own friends.The last gasp of the arcade was to try to offer an experience that a player couldn&rsquo;t have at home. Dance Dance Revolution, Beatmania, Guitar Freaks, and Drum Mania were all developed in this winding down of the arcade. All of these machines were simply too large and specialized to be something that you could easily play at home. This wasn&rsquo;t joysticks and buttons, this was ruggedized dance pads and simulated drum kits. If you wanted to play these games, you had to leave your house.&nbsp;Dance Maniax was released in the very early 2000&rsquo;s and consisted of a set of infrared sensors that you waved your hand across in time to a musical track and on screen instructions. No buttons. Nothing physical to interact with. Just a giant cabinet and your own sense of self consciousness. The Bemani series of rhythm games ended up with the same core issue as fighting games. People wanted to play them because they were fun to play, but some people got so good at them that the developers needed to up the challenge with each new release and the performative aspect of being very good at a game in public meant that some people would play it, but most would not. Those other people went back home and played guitar hero and rock band privately or with their friends. I mean why play a game with a bunch of people standing around judging you.&nbsp;That sure was a lot of non Beat Saber talk for a presumably Beat Saber focused Best Games, isn&rsquo;t it?I think the history is important, because of how and Beat Saber was developed and released. Beat Saber is a rhythm game very similar in play to Dance Maniax. To an outside observer, you wave your hands in the air to the beat of a song and look sort of silly or cool or somewhere in between. The difference is, Beat Saber is a VR game. It really only works as a VR game. While that limits its potential audience, this does mean that you don&rsquo;t have to wait in line to play Beat Saber, and you especially don&rsquo;t have to worry about people watching you and judging your performance&hellip; if you don&rsquo;t want them to. When you are in Beat Saber, it&rsquo;s just you, two laser swords, and a lot of incoming blocks to slice. Get good at it if you want. Play it on easy if you want. Play the songs that you want, and enjoy yourself. If you turn off any screen mirroring, only you will ever see how well you did. Or, you could stream out your game and show anyone who will watch how amazing you are at slicing blocks. It&rsquo;s up to you.&nbsp;There is an argument to be made that Beat Saber could have been developed for the Nintendo Wii or for the Playstation Move Controllers. But it wasn&rsquo;t and moving it to a system where the action is displayed on a standard screen just wouldn&rsquo;t work at this point. No, Beat Saber is a VR experience through and through, and all the better for it.There will be a lot of new VR systems past this current generation. Head mounted display units that are lighter, faster, work completely untethered and don&rsquo;t require controllers at all. For each of these units there will be a version of Beat Saber. In 15 years when a VR/AR system can be placed in regular glasses frames or light-weight goggles there will be a version of Beat Saber. When you can stand in a light field projection with no hardware at all attached to your body, there will be a version of Beat Saber. If one of the tests for new gaming hardware is to run Tetris or Doom on it, the test for new VR hardware will be, from now on, to run Beat Saber on it.Beat Saber isn&rsquo;t very old, but it&rsquo;s already one of the best games.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThis past weekend was Global Game Jam. This will be the tenth GGJ that I have attended but the first time that the game I worked on doesn&rsquo;t play on a computer. I teamed up with Paul and Logan Cooper to work on a board game. A 3D printed board game. In 48 hours.&nbsp;3D printing is not a quick process. It does provide regular people with the facility to create physical objects relatively easily and cheaply, but rapid prototyping is only rapid when compared to other forms of manufacture. We shifted the usual Game Jam constraint of technology over to a constraint of logistics. Getting everything designed, modelled, printed, and tested in 48 hours was tricky.&nbsp;In the end we completed and play tested the prototype of an actually interesting table-top game. It plays in less than an hour. There are some interesting strategic elements. It&rsquo;s pretty easy to learn. After a few more revisions, I have no doubt that it could be quite fun.Given the time we had to create it, we didn&rsquo;t get a chance to test it with more than 2 players, but it does seem like more players could work very well. That might even be the prefered way to play it.Anyway, if you have a 3d printer and wanted to test out an interesting game prototype, you can download the files here&nbsp; https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/treasuretrap-dungeon-game-8       \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWe have traveled to Disney parks a few times now. On each trip I spend a percentage of it just studying the construction of, well, everything. There are so many small details in those parks that aren&rsquo;t the products of chance. Each small scrape carved into the artificial stone, each crack snaking its way through a wooden pillar, each trail of rust drifting down from simulated steel rivets. All of those details have been placed there and maintained meticulously in the hope that you will never notice them. Individually these details are works of talented craftspeople worthy of respect and praise. Combined, they become invisible. Just one one small contribution the intended effect; to transport an audience of park attendees to another place and time. They will become wrapped up in the story going on around them. The real magic to Disney parks is that you are never supposed to know it&rsquo;s a trick.Game designs are, for the most part, linear. This is a feature built into the medium. The player is supposed to play through each level, area, or challenge, completing them and moving forward until they reach the end. Game designers are taught to always direct the player in subtle and overt ways. The grandest sin is to leave the player feeling directionless and lost. The design drum beat repeatedly since the arcade days that the objective must always be clear and the path too it must be obvious. There is no other way, or other ways have been tried and failed. I mean, why would anyone question the wisdom of decades of game development?Disney theme parks have one major guiding principle. Everything is built to tell the story. Everything. After you walk through the main gate the imagineers who designed the space have no control over what you look at, where you go, or how you experience it. The story of the place, the experience, must be everywhere and built into everything. Park designers can&rsquo;t control what you do, but they can try to give you some hints. Sightlines, color pallets, angles, indicators, pathways, all tools in the designers kit. The fact remains that when you are in a theme park no one will be there to tell you how to enjoy it.For years in video game design we clung to the platitude that the designer can&rsquo;t tell the player what to do. The player is a rogue element and as soon as they are let loose on a game, all bets are off. For the most part, that hasn&rsquo;t been true at all. Press A to start, press start to start, move left to right, move bottom to top, jump here, shoot here, defeat all enemies to open doors, find keycard to open doors, have this adventure in this way for this amount of time. I&rsquo;m not saying a directed experience isn&rsquo;t valid. Some truly wonderful games have been made that are absolutely on rails. For a very long time, that was really the only practical way to make games. Technical limitations required more or less linear experiences. It is now technically feasible to create unconstrained spaces, but let's not kid ourselves, most &ldquo;open world&rdquo; games are rail lines with switching stations. Design wisdom would say that you can&rsquo;t really do it any other way. The Imagineers would say otherwise.Then there are the other games. Games like Skyrim, games like Breath of the Wild, games like Outer Wilds. These games are theme parks. Subtle hints and gentle nudges are all that can be detected of the designers intent. The trick of the game, the pathing of the space, the push toward a narrative conclusion is, like the Disney parks, mostly invisible. The story is told too and by the person experiencing it, at the pace they want to experience it. Story is woven into every little detail but asks nothing specific of the player.&nbsp;When you wander around a Disney park they know that you will be waiting, they know that you will back track, they know that you will see each attraction and feature from different angles and vantages. All of these eventualities have been considered and planned for. The design language for truly wonderful open world video games was being developed before the integrated circuit was even a viable technology.~I literally wrote all of this to say that Outer Wilds isn&rsquo;t an adventure game, it&rsquo;s a theme park and it&rsquo;s wonderful and you should play it.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWhen I was at the Reboot Develop conference I attended one of the best talks I have ever seen. Thierry Boulanger talked about how he and the rest of Sabotage Studio made their game The Messenger. When the audience left the theater, I saw a lot of red eyes and sniffly noses. My own, I&rsquo;m not ashamed to say, were also red and sniffly, but I&rsquo;m sort of a softy so a particularly moving commercial might set me off.&nbsp;A talk about how a developer created a game isn&rsquo;t really something that anyone would usually classify as emotional. There are a lot of them out there. Most are about the trials of game development, some are about a specific issue or problem the team tackled. I find a lot of them very, academically, interesting. Something was very different about this particular talk.Thierry Boulanger did talk about his own personal journey, his struggles and hardships, but that wasn&rsquo;t the only thing that made an entire audience well up. There was something about the way he talked about the game that tugged at me. At the time I hadn&rsquo;t played The Messenger but I knew I would have to. Now it&rsquo;s a few months later, and I have played The Messenger, and I get it.As a game I think that The Messenger is very good. Not earth shaking, not genre defining. It&rsquo;s not the type of game that will be written up as having historic significance. I&rsquo;m certain that it will be someone&rsquo;s favorite game, because, like I said, it is very good. That someone isn&rsquo;t me, but I am glad that I played it.Structurally I thought the game had some issues. It is longer than it needs to be. The controls are very sharp and precise but some of the mechanics feel mushy. There is a randomness to some of the boss fights that doesn&rsquo;t exist anywhere else in the game. The graphics and audio are excellent but don&rsquo;t always feel cohesive area to area. The music is perfect. The music is absolutely perfect.Despite any flaws, I can easily recommend The Messenger. The one thing it is absolutely not lacking is heart. The people who made this game put absolutely everything they had into it. The Messenger gives you the impression that the Devs thought they might never get to make another. They jammed in so much stuff, so many mechanics, so many jokes, so many stories, so many choices, that the game is filled to bursting.I&rsquo;ll never know if I would have had the same response to The Messenger if I hadn&rsquo;t heard Thierry&rsquo;s talk. That&rsquo;s fine. The two creations work well together. Complement and reinforce each other. I think I understand the talk a little better now, but more importantly, I think I know why he felt he had to give it. He put everything he had into it because he didn&rsquo;t know if he would ever get to make another one.&nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - SoulcaliburSure, it doesn&rsquo;t have the banger of an intro cinematic that kicked off the previous game, Soul Edge, but Soulcalibur is an absolute masterpiece. Soulcalibur did more to elevate the fighting genre than any other game of it&rsquo;s time.&nbsp;In a year that also saw the release of Super Smash Bros., Street Fighter 3: third strike, and Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter, Soulcalibur stands apart. You see, fighting games are way too hard to play. I love them, but they are absolutely impenetrable to new players. I love that they are complex, and rich with nuance. I love that fighting games are very free-form&nbsp;and fluid. No matter how many times you have played a fighting game you can always work out new techniques and timings. Everything that I love about the genre makes them terrible for people new to them.Of course difficulty in games is nothing new and a certain amount of learning is expected every time&nbsp;you play an unfamiliar game. The main problem is that most fighting games are absolutely obnoxious in their refusal to teach you anything at all about how to play them. Of the other major fighting series I mentioned up there, only Super Smash Bros. makes an attempt. Poorly.Soulcalibur started as an arcade game. Simple, straight forward, 1 on 1 combat designed to eat quarters. When it made its way home as a North American launch title on the Sega Dreamcast, the developers could easily have left it at that. Basic 1 on 1 fighting, and maybe a tournament mode or something.Instead, they added Mission mode. A massive sprawling story based around different types of fights with different rules and requirements. It would be easy to think that this was just a way to extend the playtime of a basic fighting game, but Mission mode does something fighting games just don&rsquo;t do. It teaches you how to play the game. Not in a tutorial &ldquo;hit this button now&rdquo; kind of way, but in a deep many hours of practice kind of way. You won&rsquo;t be able to mash your way through all of the fights and you will have to use different techniques and characters to pass the challenges. It&rsquo;s fun, it&rsquo;s engaging, and you won&rsquo;t realize how much better you are getting at it until you play against another person and chain together some massive combo, or sidestep a potentially devastating blow. This is a fighting game that makes you better at it while you are playing it. Truly a rare bird.I can set aside how I was obsessed with the Kilik kata animation before the game even came out and how I must have watched it a thousand times since. I can set aside how I played it on the Dreamcast until my thumb hurt and I burnt out a VMU while playing it. No, I&rsquo;ll go with this; Soulcalibur is a fighting game that makes you better at playing it while you play it, and for that it will always be one of the best games.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Worms 2In the early 1970s, computers were wildly expensive machines that occupied entire rooms of universities and research centers. Students and scientists would have to book time on them to do their work, often accessing them remotely from terminals. They would have to master early high level programming languages and think in trigonometric functions. With such specialized training and access to rare and costly hardware, they did what anyone would have done. They made and played games.One of the earliest tasks for electro-mechanical and electronic computers was calculating firing arcs for long range ship cannons. When computers advanced from relays to transistors to integrated circuits, the desire for the navies, armies, and air forces of the world to figure out how to shoot at what they are shooting at didn&rsquo;t go away. If anything, shooting at things rose to the level of complexity afforded by newer computers. Shooting at things became a science. If it seems like a lot of computer games are simply about things shooting at other things, it might be because that was quite literally what computers were made for. Like it or not, performing ballistic calculations is built into computers from the bones out.In the late 1960s and early 1970s there was a pervasive shift toward antiwar sentiment in the research centers and universities of north america. And yet they were using computers. Computers for which ballistic arcs and missile flight dynamics were essentially solved problems. A lot of the basic languages included functions to define these arcs. The tools were all there, but the want to use them for their intended purpose was not. So people did what people will always do. They made a game out of them.Artillery isn&rsquo;t really a single computer game. There isn&rsquo;t one monolithic work that you can point to and say &lsquo;that is Artillery&rsquo;. Instead, artillery was an entire genre of computer games back in a time when genres for computer games didn&rsquo;t really exist. Two or more gun emplacements would take turns firing at each other. Players would have to adjust the guns power and angle for each shot gradually trying to narrow in on their target. First one hit loses. Everyone programming a computer could play with and modify a version of Artillery. There were ones with changing wind, ones with variable terrain, ones where the gun emplacements could move and ones where they were ships on the sea. All of them variations on the same game.Sometimes it isn&rsquo;t the game that explores a mechanic first that is remembered. Sometimes it isn&rsquo;t even a game explores that mechanic best. Sometimes it is a game that just does it the most. Worms 2 is the most Artillery game ever made.Now of course, there was a Worms game before Worms 2, but it was really just Artillery in a comedy suit. Worms 2 though, they put everything in there. Every Worm had a goofy name and a slate of ridiculous voice samples for all situations. The amount of tools and weapons at your disposal is staggering, and most of them are bad puns and corny jokes. In 1997, nearly 30 years of Artillery style games were rolled into a single chuckle-worthy package. There have been a lot of Worms games since Worms 2, but not many have captured the joyous chaos of that game. Like using a sword to cut a cake or high explosives to create vibrant fireworks, Worms 2 took the core concepts of Artillery and repurposed them to entertain. What had been developed essentially as a weapon was transformed into whoopee cushions and cartoon googly eyes.Worms 2 is the most perfect form of the Artillery genre, and a crowning achievement in irreverence. Worms 2 is also one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI attended the RebootDevelop Red game development conference this past week. Somewhere, tucked away in the back of my memory, is the last time I ever attended a game development related conference. When I was there I witnessed a spirited demonstration of Samba De Amigo, a maraca based rhythm game. I also tried out a version of the real time translation functionality in Phantasy Star Online. If you know either of these two games, you know that it has been quite a long time since I was at a game development convention. According to people I talked to who had attended conferences like GDC and PAX, RebootDevelop is not the usual fare.I could write stories about who I saw, what we did, and conversations that I had, but I would really rather not. There is a reason why I number rather than title all of these posts. I have a strong belief that that some experiences should be ephemeral. Some moments need not be recorded. I realize that all of these posts are searchable and discoverable, but I don&rsquo;t really make it easy. Maybe for the internet that is ephemeral enough.Here is what I will say. I don&rsquo;t know if I have ever been more convinced that what I am trying to do, making games, is the only thing I should be doing. It&rsquo;s not that I couldn&rsquo;t do other things. I certainly spent a long enough time in the various branches of advertising. If I needed to I could probably create store displays, commercials, and promotional banners again. But that isn&rsquo;t what I should be doing. I should be making games.Every person I talked with, every person I had even a brief interaction with while at lunch or refilling coffee or ordering my third beer for the night, every single one of them was working in games because if they didn&rsquo;t, no one else would.The long and short of it is, making games is incredibly hard. It&rsquo;s technically, artistically, economically, and emotionally hard. Everyone I met had skills that could take them far in other industries. They could all be wildly successful doing anything easier than making games. But they weren&rsquo;t doing other things, because they couldn&rsquo;t do other things.At some point during the three day conference I was in the middle of a conversation with a game developer and I realized something. The game they were telling me about the game they were proud of, and had put so much of their effort and passion into, if they hadn&rsquo;t worked on it, no one would have. That game would simply have never existed without that one person&rsquo;s dedication. The thing was, it was a very good game. It needed to exist. The world is a better place because that game exists. And without that one person, that game would not &lsquo;be&rsquo;.&nbsp;There are games that I want to see in the world. There are games that I think need to exist. The only thing stopping them is that I haven&rsquo;t made them yet. I need to change that.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - The Fighting Fantasy Book SeriesYou ever play a roguelike? A game where you have one run through a gauntlet of obstacles. When your character dies you go back to the start and try again, using what you learned on previous runs to get further and further each time. Imagine that, but a book.A few short years after the creation of the first Choose Your Own Adventure books and the game Dungeons and Dragons, a couple of industrious writers decided to mix the two together. The result, rather than being a dungeon crawling choose your own adventure, turned out to be more like a story based roguelike. You had one shot to optimise your randomly rolled characters progress through the story. If they died or you chose poorly and got a bad ending you had to scrap your character sheet and start over at the beginning.Of course no one ever played through the books like that. When the quickload system is as easy as putting a finger in between the pages and then flipping back if a choice or combat outcome turned out negatively, you fudge the numbers until you got all the endings. At least for me, it was only after I had &lsquo;beat&rsquo; the book that I decided to see if I could make a run through to the end playing strictly by the rules. Most of the time I didn&rsquo;t make it. A few of the books required some pretty lucky dice rolls to succeed.&nbsp;Really though, when everything is considered, the fighting fantasy series didn&rsquo;t do anything earthshakingly inventive. They were neat, and of their time, and that&rsquo;s about it. It&rsquo;s really only when you combine the infocom text adventures like Zork, the tabletop collaborative narrative games like Dungeons and Dragons, and systems based computer games like Rogue that were all being made in the late 70s and early 80s that you can see the profound impact they will collectively make on games over the next decades. Games went from being strictly intellectual or gambling based pastimes, to being a medium that could tell a story. Games became the only medium where you could not only be the audience for that story but a collaborator in its telling. Very early on the Fighting Fantasy series of books were out front and testing those waters.The Fighting Fantasy book series deserves to be amoung the best games.&nbsp;&#8203;&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\thttps://eturnip.itch.io/anythingThis weekend was Ludem Dare 45. Ludem Dare is a long running series of semi-annual game jams. I did the same thing that I do every time Ludem Dare rolls around. I forgot it was happening. It wasn&rsquo;t until quite late on friday night that I noticed that the theme had been announced. I thought about it for a bit, started a new Godot Project, made a GitHub repository, and then thought maybe I would attempt to make the thing I was thinking about on Saturday. Maybe.Start with nothing. That was the theme. I happened to have an experiment rattling around my brain I have wanted to try for a long time. It is the sort of thing that fit the theme &ldquo;Start with nothing&rdquo; and it was a small, strange idea that fit perfectly into the schedule of a jam. Really I just needed an excuse to try it out.For a while now the kids and I have been messing around with Godot as an excuse to teach them to code in a way that might be more fun than tutorials and &ldquo;learn to code&rdquo; apps. Game engines, I think, are uniquely suited to the task of learning. Turn around time from having an idea to testing it to seeing the results is very short for most things when using a game engine. An awful lot of the work is handled for you. You don&rsquo;t really need to be concerned about how to draw a pixel to the screen. The engine deals with that. You can worry about higher level stuff. I know that the absolute fastest code learning loop is probably learning html but that is pretty dull stuff. Compare changing the border on a div to creating a stack of boxes and knocking them over with cannon shots in a 3d game engine. The second one might take a bit longer, but honestly, which one would you rather make.&nbsp;That time spent working with my kids in Godot led me to believe that creating a simple experiment wouldn&rsquo;t be that difficult. Of course I was completely wrong. I certainly didn&rsquo;t spend global game jam type hours on this project. I sort of dipped into it from time to time over Saturday and Sunday morning. Still, Godot fought me the entire way.Seemingly small things like moving an object from one place to another smoothly devolved into a marathon of frustration. I spent no small amount of Saturday detangling the fact that Godot deals with 2D and 3D graphics very differently. The built in tween functions are either broken or so convoluted that they might as well be broken, at least on the 3D side of the fence. The documentation is succinct, but not particularly helpful. If there are examples they don&rsquo;t tend to be ones that deal with common problems, like moving an object smoothly from place to place. I&rsquo;m also not very familiar with the python-like GDscript that you have to use if you want to make a Godot project that runs under HTML5. Not being able to use C# caused some headaches.&nbsp;At the end of it all though, I did manage to make a very simple version of what I was going for. It&rsquo;s missing some of the more interesting exploration style features that I had planned, but like all Jam games, success is when it runs at all.Anything is running over at https://eturnip.itch.io/anythingTry it out. Make something from nothing.\t\t"

I will, from time to time, point at a sign or logo while out in the world and say to whoever I&rsquo;m with &ldquo;hey I made that&rdquo;, but that&rsquo;s about the depths of my braggadocio. I have had animations I made in TV commercials and up on billboards. I never saved any of them for a demo reel. I have made logos and designs for products and companies. None of them are in my portfolio. I don&rsquo;t really even have a proper portfolio right now. There are a few videos of me making some old models and doing some quick paintings, but that is about it. I should probably look at changing&nbsp;that.I would like to start now, if even in a small way. For the few dozen people who read this (I get the metrics. On very rare occasions readership leaps all the way into the low hundreds!) I invite you to stop reading and head over tohttps://store.steampowered.com/app/990900/Neon_Noodles__Cyberpunk_Kitchen_Automation/Neon Noodles is an open ended puzzle game being developed by Radu Muresan. I have been contributing on the art side. I happen to think it&rsquo;s shaping up into a pretty cool game. A writer for Forbes seemed to think so too&nbsp;(https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissabrinks/2019/09/09/the-7-best-indie-games-i-played-at-pax-west-2019/#6d3f74443e1c )&nbsp;so that&rsquo;s a nice bit of outside validation.If you use Steam to buy games, please add Neon Noodles to your wish list and consider giving it a look when it releases later this year. If you don&rsquo;t use Steam to buy games, tell someone you know who does. If you are better at promotion than me, go shout it from the rooftops. It might take me awhile to do any proper promotion. I&rsquo;m still learning how.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tDuring the last weeks of their summer vacation, my kids and I started up a small game dev experiment. I described it as an extended Game Jam. We only worked on in a couple hours a day at most. The project is on a small hiatus while they got back into the regular rhythm of school again, but we still talk about how to solve certain problems and what we still need to do on the game.Rather than teach them how to use Unity, I figured it would be more interesting if we all learned something we were unfamiliar with. We are using the open source Godot engine and writing all the code in the python-like GDscript. The only python experience I have is writing a few automation scripts for Blender, so I wasn&rsquo;t coming to this with any sort of head start.The project is based off a concept I had a long time ago for a simple 3 Lane endless runner type game. The hook would be that rather than be about dodging items in your path, this game would be about holding up traffic and not letting it squeeze past you.&nbsp;So far we have gotten a player character into the game and we have set up controls for it. You can use the keyboard or gamepad to move your little person around. We have set up and used trigger objects to detect the position of the &lsquo;people&rsquo; trying to make their way past you. We have messed around with the Godot physics engine to drop items from the sky and shoot them toward the player at variable speed. We have messed with the camera, but not yet done anything with lighting and shading. We have set up an object spawning system to create the objects we need when we need them and a culling system to remove objects when they are out of view.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a long way to go before I would call this project an actual game, but the kids have created some concepts for new characters along with their traits, and we have a decent plan on how to use what we have learned to add more structure to the game.Some of our ideas won&rsquo;t work out, and I have been pretty clear with them that this is what happens every time you make something as large and ungainly as a game. Some things just don&rsquo;t work and some things do, but either way you learn something new.I don&rsquo;t feel like I am any more comfortable with python, but I think I understand some of the basic concepts of the Godot engine. I think that it is a very simple and elegant system, but one that can lead to a lot of clutter if not wrangled properly. When Godot can easily build to more platforms it will likely be a very viable game engine for indie devs.This past weekend we didn&rsquo;t do any work on our project, but I plan to rectify that next weekend and we can all come back to it with fresh eyes and new ideas ready to be tested.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Sid Meier&rsquo;s Civilization Revolution DSSometimes constraints can drive the best designs. Necessity being the mother of invention or whatever. I am here today to argue that not only is Civ Rev on the Nintendo DS a good port of the game, I&rsquo;m going to say that it is one of the best Civ games in the series.&nbsp;Ridiculous? Blasphemous? Not a real Gamer&trade;? Maybe, but just hear me out. If you can get ahold of Civ Rev for DS, just play it. You&rsquo;ll thank me in a day or two when you finally blink.I&rsquo;ll admit, I haven&rsquo;t played every game in the Civ series, but I have put in the hours with a lot of them to know how the games tick. More than that, a few years ago I tried to examine what made the core loop of the Civilizations games so addictive. In other words, what made them good.&nbsp;You might think that the magnetic effect of the Civilization series is the simulation of a world spanning fanciful take on human history. A ludic examination of everything that it took to get us to where we are.&nbsp; That ain&rsquo;t it. Civ games are slot machines that payout tiny rewards continuously for five hours. Microscopic prizes at a metronomic pace. Everytime you press a button in a Civ game something happens, and often it is something you knew would happen, but you didn&rsquo;t know when. You press a button and a city spawns a new settler. You press a button and discover a friendly village. You press a button and a wonder you had forgotten you were building springs into existence. You press a button and you conquer France.Of course you are rewarded for planning ahead and strategically micromanaging your many towns and peoples. There is an element of skill to the game. You can make too many poor choices and end up with revolts and invasions decimating everything you have spent centuries building. But that isn&rsquo;t what makes anyone play one more turn at 3:45 in the morning. It&rsquo;s that casino game &lsquo;Ka-ching&rsquo; of pressing a button and having a brand new rifleman appear in one of your cities.&nbsp;Since every Civ game works this way, you might be wondering what makes the DS version so special. What would elevate that particular version to the rank of best games. Typically, as a game marches down the technological ladder they get worse not better.Civ games are packed right full of all sorts of stuff. There is a technology tree spanning millennia,&nbsp; there is a civilopedia that includes actual historical information along with what amounts to the games manual. There are a variety of units, both military and civilian, you can use to explore, settle, defend, and conquer the world. All cool, but none of that makes the game a better game.When they crunched all of Civilization down into Civ Rev for the DS they condensed everything. The pace, the scope, the complexity, the reward cycle. There is a possible version of Civ Rev DS where the reward cycle is exploitative, where playing the game takes a backseat to flashing lights and binging alarms. That isn&rsquo;t what happened at all. Civ Rev is every bit a Civ game only smaller. Tighter. Quicker. More nimble. It takes the best parts of Civ and squashes them down into a bite sized package.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Civ Rev DS the best game in the series. No, probably not. But it is one of the best games on the DS platform, and it succeeds in ways no one would expect of a &lsquo;down port&rsquo;. No concessions, no exceptions, it&rsquo;s just a great game.Sid Meier&rsquo;s Civilization Revolution is one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tVery early on in this blog, like 2013 early, I wrote about wanting to switch from Maya to Blender. It was a long and frustrating process. For quite a few years I suffered from a sort of software phantom limb syndrome where I would continually hit the wrong hotkeys or search for tools using the wrong names. While it ain&rsquo;t busting rocks, there was a certain amount of psychological pain associated with the transition.&nbsp;Now, barely a day goes by when I don&rsquo;t fire up Blender to do something. I have my own custom keymap that I blindly jab at and really only remember in the tips of my fingers. From time to time I will even write tiny, simple python scripts to automate some tasks. Before Blender I had never even wanted to venture into the python language. I follow several news sources and development blogs to pick up information about the newest versions. I may or may not have fallen asleep to the soothing voice of Pablo from the Blender Today youtube channel. Okay I definitely did. A couple of times. I&rsquo;m completely in the bag for Blender.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not just me. To the outside observer, the latest version of Blender, 2.8, is pretty much indistinguishable from the polished and user focussed commercial software that it competes with. I&rsquo;ll understand if you don&rsquo;t take my word for that, since I am admittedly in the bag for Blender. Epic Games and Ubisoft have recently backed Blender as one of their go to art creation tools. They are only the most high profile of the companies backing or using Blender on a day to day basis. There are many others across the games, video production, advertising, and special effects industries. 3D printing and prop making is another pool that I have a toe in, and they are Blender day in and day out over there.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think that Blender will ever fully replace Maya or Max or Cinema 4D or whatever it is people use. I don&rsquo;t even think that it should. Some folks are very comfortable with the tools that they use and they really have no incentive to change. There are some tools like ZBrush and Houdini that are invaluable for some people for specific tasks. I think that&rsquo;s great. I also know that for what I do, I have yet to hit any walls with Blender.&nbsp;If nothing else they now have a proper object organizations structure that works better than any other I have ever seen. They went from having an obscure unlabeled layer model that was one of the dumbest things I have ever had the misfortune to use, to a nesting &lsquo;collections&rsquo; system that works so elegantly, within days of using it, I changed my own workflow habits to better fit their system and could never imagine going back.If you are like me, and you tried Blender in the past only to bounce off of it, I think that version 2.8 might be what you were waiting for.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - UNOI don&rsquo;t think I will get much into the rules of UNO. If you are reading this, you have probably played the game and you already have a pretty good idea how it works. You know that it is a card shedding game where you have to match the color or number of the last played card. You and the other players keep taking turns slapping down cards out of your own hand while trying to make everyone else hold onto as many cards as possible. If you win a round, the cards your opponents are holding count toward your point total. You know that you have to call out &lsquo;UNO!&rsquo; when you have one card left. The game almost demands that you and every member of your family / friend group unearth their most ruthlessly nitpicking selves, ready to punish anyone who forgets to call out &lsquo;UNO!&rsquo;. You know that it is like a lot of other card games, but it is also strangely more accessible than most other card games. You have probably been beaten by an 8 year old.What you may not have noticed is that UNO has a built in balancing system. A fun balancing system.&nbsp;Most competitive card games have a sort of skill curve built into them. Players who understand the systems more deeply will tend to beat players who are just starting out. The random chance of the card draw keeps the game interesting for anyone playing at higher levels. The only problem with that is, with a game like Poker as an example, other than pure chance there is no way for a less skilled player to beat a more skilled player. There is a &lsquo;good&rsquo; way to play and an endless variety of &lsquo;less good&rsquo; ways to play.&nbsp;UNO, on the other hand, has a few different paths to winning. Most players starting out will want to shed their higher value cards first and only hold on to a selection of lower value cards and action cards. This ensures that even if you don&rsquo;t win a round, you won&rsquo;t be providing many points for the person who does. This is sort of the beginner mode, and if you play it cleanly and consistently, you will probably win just as many rounds as other people at the table. Not quite luck based, but far from a deep strategy game. The simplicity and viability of this play style makes UNO an easy card game for kids to pick up.On the other end, UNO is a game where you can count cards, bluff, flat out lie, devise fiendish card traps to dump unreasonable amounts of cards on other players, and did I mention lie. The rules not only allow lying, they offer ways for players to penalize anyone they catch lying. When you play this way you are not guaranteed success over players conservatively shedding cards and laying down actions. One way is not better than the other. ONE WAY IS NOT BETTER THAN THE OTHER.This is where you say &lsquo;Then UNO isn&rsquo;t a game of skill. It&rsquo;s just all luck! If more experienced players can&rsquo;t always trounce less experienced players this game is garbage!&rsquo;.&nbsp; Poor deluded player. That&rsquo;s not the point. UNO is a game where, no matter your experience level, you can be competitive. If you are just learning the rules, and play a clean game, you&rsquo;re gonna do okay. If you have played a lot of UNO you can bend the rules, bluff often, and draw cards when you don&rsquo;t need to in the hopes of filling another players hand with a real lumber yard&rsquo;s worth of cards. You can be devious. You can be nasty. You can make the game fun in the way that you want.When you are playing a card game as a family, or playing with younger kids, there is often a &lsquo;Let the Wookie Win&rsquo; problem. Kids hate to lose. No one likes to lose, but kids really really hate it. UNO is a game where you don&rsquo;t really have to worry about that. Once they understand the rules, that kid is going to win a decent amount of the time anyway. Everyone can play however they want and it will still always come down to the last 3 or four cards. UNO is like the Mario Kart of card games. While that does mean that a certain demographic will have trouble taking UNO seriously, and I would suggest never betting money on a game of UNO, it does one thing right that a lot of other games get wrong.No matter who is playing UNO, they can have fun.That alone puts UNO up there among the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tIt&rsquo;s nearly 40 years since the Rubik's Cube came out. I just learned how to solve one yesterday.I can&rsquo;t really take any credit for that. Tutorials and guides have obviously existed for decades. Whatever depths there are to plumb in that plastic toy have been fully plumbed. I think I even had a second hand book on How to Master the Cube, or something like that but I don&rsquo;t know that I ever got more than a page or two into it. We had a couple of cubes, a pyramid, some 2x2&rsquo;s from cereal boxes, and, I think, a ball. I don&rsquo;t remember ever solving any of them. If I had any interest in learning how to solve one I certainly didn&rsquo;t apply it.The real reason that I can&rsquo;t take any credit for learning how to solve a Rubik&rsquo;s Cube, is because I didn&rsquo;t. My son did.&nbsp;There seems to have been a resurgence of the Rubik's Cube speed solving fad. At least among my son and his friends. One day he asked where the Rubik&rsquo;s Cube was. We had picked one up at a garage sale years ago and left it in the car as a potential distraction during long trips. Like a great majority of the worlds Rubik&rsquo;s Cubes, it had probably been played with half a dozen times. It had grit and something sticky on it, but it still worked. He used it a few times before taking it apart, cleaning it up, and lubricating the surfaces so that it moved fairly smoothly again.Over the next week of so, he would sit on the couch for extended spans just watching youtube videos and reading pages about solving the cube while practicing the moves required to jostle its faces into position. It wasn&rsquo;t long before he could solve it repeatedly and started to work on increasing his speed.&nbsp;Sometimes you just need implied permission to do something. The Rubik&rsquo;s Cube is almost as old as I am and, being a curious sort about puzzles and games, I&rsquo;ve always wanted to know how it worked. Sometime over the past few decades, I did find out that it wasn&rsquo;t terribly complicated and you only needed to memorize a small set of moves and patterns. Memorizing small sets of moves and patterns pretty much describes any work I have done since my 20s, so I figured how hard could it be. Still, until my son did it, and in turn provided me with implied permission to try, I wasn&rsquo;t likely to dedicate myself to it for any length of time. Now I had a teacher if something wasn&rsquo;t making sense and someone who knew the process well enough to ask cube questions in cube terms.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll probably never be as fast at it as he is, but that&rsquo;s okay. I have zero interest in competing at Rubik&rsquo;s Cube solving. If he is or isn&rsquo;t, then that&rsquo;s okay too. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just nice to know that if you decide to learn a thing, you probably can. It makes learning all the other things that seem complicated a little less daunting.&nbsp;&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Forza MotorsportI'm not really a car guy. A lot of my family are very mechanically inclined. They might even qualify as car guys. I grew up in a car guy town. So much so that a lot of the car guys were girls. Maybe a car folks town. I have paged through the autotrader. I know the difference between a hemi and rotary. I change my own oil and have done minor maintenance on every car I have ever driven. Still, I don&rsquo;t consider myself a car guy. From time to time, I can brush up against what it might be like to be a car guy. Almost always because of a video game.Well before I was old enough to have a licence I played a lot of the game Test Drive on a 286 pc. I played it not because it was a particularly good simulation of driving, but because it included a Ferrari Testarossa in the lineup of exotic sports cars. This was a car feverishly fetishized among my peers. I couldn&rsquo;t even tell you why, but I wanted to drive that Ferrari, and I wanted to drive it fast. Unfortunately Test Drive, as a game, really couldn&rsquo;t live up to the aspiration. You pilot a sports car down a cliffside road and veering to either side will cause you to crash. Traffic on the road is a constant hazzard, but you can only see about 20 meters in front of you so you will probably crash. If you over rev your engine, your windshield inexplicably shatters, and yep, that counts as a crash. Less a driving game and more a waiting for a tow truck game.For the briefest moments, I was something like a car guy. Just without all the messy interest in actual cars.By the time the original Gran Turismo came out on the Playstation, I had been driving for a while. I remember searching the car list for my Crown Victoria and mid 80&rsquo;s Toyota Supra but coming up empty. I had to be content with driving the games version of the Subaru Impreza. While my interest in racing games and car games had definitely increased, &nbsp;my aspirations had been tempered somewhat. Driving pretend cars that I could possibly drive in real life seemed a lot more fun. That was probably because I now had a frame of reference. I knew what driving, even driving fast, felt like and trying to recreate that feeling in a game was exciting. While Gran Turismo was a fun game, it didn&rsquo;t really feel like driving. Conveying the feeling of speed and momentum was beyond the capabilities of a game from 1997 (spoilers: it&rsquo;s still beyond the capabilities of a video game, mostly)In real life, I drove the Toyota Supra until it finally gave up. I played racing and driving games on the Playstation, the Dreamcast, the Playstation 2, and the XBox. None of them felt like actually driving and none of them made me any more interested in cars. Hovercrafts maybe, but not cars. Until I played Forza Motorsport.Forza Motorsport was packed full of cars to drive and tracks to drive them on. Still no sign of my Supra but I had gotten used to that. More important though, it included one crucial addition. Forza Motorsport included a driving line. The driving line in Forza Motorsport is a truly wonderful thing. The option to turn on the driving line is in the assists menu. The developers considered it a cheat. A way to make the game easier. The real beauty of the driving line is that it makes Forza Motorsport feel more like actually driving.There are no video games that can recreate the feeling of driving a car. The force of acceleration. A hard turn or slamming the brakes. The graphics and sound can attempt to recreate everything in precise glowing detail, and with VR you can even experience all of that from inside the car, but if you are not moving, you won&rsquo;t feel like you are moving. The driving line in Forza is like braille for your sense of motion. What you can&rsquo;t feel, it attempts to recreate using a curving line in shades of green and red. Is it perfect? No, far from it. But the driving line in Forza, after I had gotten used to it, let me experience a closer approximation of driving than I had ever experienced before in a driving game. I went on to race dozens of hours on those tracks. I raced a Subaru Impreza even in races where it wasn&rsquo;t the best car to choose. I tuned cars and swapped out parts. I tweaked and adjusted tiny nuances to make the cars drive just as I liked.For a short while, I was a car guy. Well maybe not really, but I did play as one in a video game. Forza Motorsport is one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Pac-ManThere are a lot of games that I tend to shy away from when I write one of these. Games that are so universally loved, and commented on, that it&rsquo;s difficult to find anything interesting to add. I could write a bunch of drivel about how the game plays, how it makes retreat an advantageous strategy, or how Pac-Man is the originator, and pinnacle, of the maze chase genre. Probably stuff you already know and probably stuff you don&rsquo;t need to read again.That&rsquo;s fine though. I&rsquo;m going to cover a different aspect of Pac-Man. This post could apply to so many classic, celebrated, games. The really interesting thing about Pac-Man is that the developers didn&rsquo;t know what made it good. No one did, at least not until much, much later.It&rsquo;s obvious that Namco, and designer Toru Iwatani, knew that Pac-Man was fun. At the time of the games release in 1980 they promoted it heavily to arcade owners. It is telling though, that Namco positioned Rally-X to be the big hit over Pac-Man. If you don&rsquo;t remember Rally-X I&rsquo;ll save you having to google it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally-X . Rally-X isn&rsquo;t a bad game at all, but it was nowhere near as successful as Pac-Man. Few things ever were, or will be.Here is where I&rsquo;m going to make a slight jaunt into game designer land. I&rsquo;ll link to an article here that explains how that ghost path-finding&nbsp;and AI system works. I&rsquo;ll also link to a video that explains the same thing in case you don&rsquo;t want to read the post.https://gameinternals.com/post/2072558330/understanding-pac-man-ghost-behaviorhttps://youtu.be/ICwzQ0_RCcQThe ghost path-finding&nbsp;system in Pac-Man is a work of genius on the level of the knight from chess. A very simple set of rules that can be re-purposed&nbsp;and reapplied to dizzyingly satisfying effect. A system that seems restrictively simple but allows for the chaos required to evoke &lsquo;fun&rsquo;.I&rsquo;ve written and talked a lot about &lsquo;fun&rsquo; here. I&rsquo;m pretty convinced that predicting patterns out of seeming chaos is what humans experience as fun. Successfully leading a target when throwing a ball, quickly navigating uneven ground, or even just tossing an object from one hand to the other. All of these have a finite set of variables, but they are far too many to actually calculate while you are completing the task. You have to predict the outcome using only your own pattern recognition skills and your estimations of the systems involved. Even a slow, methodical, game like chess involves an effectively random element, in the other player. You have to predict what will happen next based on what you know of the game and what you know of your opponent. It&rsquo;s not too surprising that predicting outcomes to potentially random events is also an innate survival skills in humans. We find effective survival fun.The game system of Pac-Man is a predictable pattern with enough variables to appear random. Since it isn&rsquo;t actually random, the player can push on the system to affect outcomes. The first time you turn Pac-Man around and see one of the ghosts reverse direction as well the pattern of that registers somewhere in your instinct centers. The ghosts aren&rsquo;t random, they operate based on rules and you can exploit that. Several people have, and, if done perfectly you can get the highest possible score and break the game. Perfect pattern prediction. You can jump through an example of that here and it is fascinating to watch. https://youtu.be/AuoH0vz3MqkPac-Man was released almost 40 years ago. People have had a while to pull it apart and figure out how it ticks. But it wasn&rsquo;t until the release of Pac-Man Championship Edition in 2007 that the original designer of the game figured out how to replicate it. Ms.Pac-Man, the superior sequel (depending on who you ask) was a conversion of the original and used most of the same underlying systems, and so it was a similarly successful game. Pac-Man Plus was likewise a conversion of the original game with a few minor tweaks. It is less well known, but plays roughly the same as Pac-Man and Ms.Pac-Man. Neither of these conversions were worked on by the original team at Namco and were more or less &lsquo;bootlegs that went legit&rsquo; so all of the actual gameplay can be squarely and fairly attributed to the original developers of Pac-Man.The first real sequel created by members of the same team as the original was Super Pac-Man. Super Pac-Man was a maze chase with mild puzzle elements that, while expanding on the original never really lived up to it either. The players attention is pulled in too many directions and the active threat and the system that you are trying to manipulate are disconnected in ways that aren&rsquo;t as satisfying. Not a bad game, but not on the level of Pac-Man either. After that there are a string of strange, occasionally interesting, and sometimes terrible Pac-Man related games. Baby Pac-Man is a half pinball half arcade game hybrid that is mediocre at both. Jr. Pac-Man is another bootleg level development that makes the maze larger than the screen, but doesn&rsquo;t actually improve it in any way. In fact, not being able to see the whole maze makes the game arguably worse. Pac-Land is a side scrolling platformer that has nothing to do with Pac-Man and isn&rsquo;t a particularly good platformer. When the original team came back to try their hand at a revival in 1987 with Pac-Mania, they created a game that worked on nostalgia alone. Pac-Mania shrinks the view-able&nbsp;area of the maze down to a tiny tile of the whole. It evokes Pac-Man, but it is a much more reactive game. The ability to predict patterns and exploit them is hamstrung by the visible play area and the perspective. The developers knew what made a Pac-Man game, but were lost when it came to what actually made it fun. Lots of people tried to make a new Pac-Man game through the intervening years but they wouldn&rsquo;t really hit success until Pac-Man Championship Edition in 2007. Less of a &lsquo;Maze Chase&rsquo; and more of a snake like game, the object is to build up a long train of ghosts following hot on your heels and then choose your moment to eat a power pellet and turn on all of them. The game rewards quick pattern recognition and path planning, but eventually gets so fast that you would require superhuman reflexes to execute your plans. A tough game, but it activates those fun centers just as well as the original.Namco and Toru Iwatani had captured the essence of fun with Pac-Man but it took them almost 30 years to do it again without just copying the original. The history of Pac-Man is a good lesson that just because someone creates something successful, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they know how they did it, or how to do it again.Pac-Man remains one of the best games. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI'm going to post up writing of a different sort today. I have reworked the rules of the board game I have been making. I reworked them so hard that I removed the 'board' aspect of the game entirely, and now the whole game is played with cards. The old version was, to put is succinctly, dull. Dull isn't something you want a game to be, and so, the reworking of the rules. Below is part of the new rule document. I'm going to leave out the combat phase of play for now, since I still haven't play tested the new style and they will likely change at least a bit. Anyway, here you go.&nbsp;Adventure Caddie - V. 0.95DescriptionYou and your cohort are professional Adventure Caddies. You won&rsquo;t be doing any actual fighting, but it is your job to carry, organize, and repair your Heroes supplies. You are also responsible for some high level Adventure coaching. When to step back, when to rush forward, that sort of thing.Now, no one wants to stay a Caddie forever. You all have dreams of getting into the Pro Adventurers Guild. The fame, the glory, the treasure, the parties. Free danishes in the break room. All the perks.The first hurdle is the cost. You are going to have to pay the guild membership and it isn&rsquo;t cheap. The second is recommendations. Nobody was ever accepted into the guild without at least one recommendation. The more recommendations you can get, the better your chances of snagging one of those rare Hero positions.ObjectivesGet the entire party of Heroes through the adventure alive. If any of the Heroes is down at the end of an adventure, the guild demands that the entire group give up half of its treasure (rounding up) to pay resurrection costs, and run another adventure of the same level or higher to redeem yourselves. No spots in the guild lineup will be granted to Caddies that fail to protect their Heroes.Earn enough Treasure to buy a Guild membership.The Heroes cut of any Treasure you pick up is accounted for and deposited into the guild run ethereal bank before you even stuff it in your bag. So what you are holding on to, is yours. At the end of an adventure, you can pay for a guild membership, choose to carry what you have into the next adventure, or pay the long term storage trolls to hold onto it for you. Sure would be nice to have access to the guild bank, but unfortunately that&rsquo;s only for Heroes.Earn recommendations.Heroes are a strange lot, and sometimes they have objectives that they want to accomplish that are seperate from the main Adventure. Is it hubris? Is it insecurity? Is it malice? Who knows. What you do know is, helping a Hero accomplish their tasks will earn you recommendations with the guild, and they just might be more valuable than gold and jewels. If more than one Caddie can pay for the guild membership at the end of an Adventure, you just know they will take the one with the most recommendations. In the case of a tie (enough treasure to pay for membership and the same number of recommendations) Both Caddies can become Pro Heroes. There is no harm in helping your fellow Caddies get into the guild if you can buy your way in as well.The game ends when one or more of your group is admitted into the guild. Everyone else will just have to try again next season.SetupAll Caddies start with a carrying capacity of 9. That means that the total bulk of the the items you can carry can only add up to less than or equal to 9. Shuffle all decks and place them on the table.Each Caddie draws one Hero from the Hero deck. Order doesn&rsquo;t matter, but you must decide amongst your group who will Caddie which Hero. Each Hero has different base stats. Draw the top card from the level one adventure deck and place it face up. A good Caddie always does some preliminary scouting, and has some idea what their Heroes might be getting into. Refer to this card when you want an idea of what enemies are on their way.Each Caddie draws 2 items from the level one loot deck and places them on the ground. If you draw a treasure piece, Place it on the bottom of the deck and draw again. Once all the items are on the ground the group must decide how to divy them up.These will be your starting items. Now suit up and get adventuring.Turn orderAll turns are taken at the same time, as a group. If Hero actions can combine into Combos, you will have to work out between you which Hero should take their action first.Start RoundHeroes use any potions, repair packs, or consumables they are holding. All of them. If you handed it to them they will drink it or use it. Remove the empties from the Heroes and throw them on the ground.Caddies can use this time to repair one point of damage on any Items they are holding.Caddies can throw one item to a Hero, and/or Request one item from a Hero.Discard any items on the ground. The Heroes have moved on and you have to move on with them. Wave goodbye&nbsp;to those items and sweep them into the discard pile. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t"

I still have characters that don't 'talk to me' but I'm very definitely finding ones that do. I don't really pick what they say, I just listen and write it down when they say it. That is sort of cool. Hopefully that will make the second draft easier to lay down than the first. Hopefully that will make the second draft better than the first. I doubt it though. Probably won't be properly 'okay' until the 3rd or 4rth draft.&nbsp;\t\t"

A ROUND TABLE SITS UNDER THE SINGLE POOL OF LIGHT IN THE ROOM. A PILE OF MAPS AND BLUEPRINTS LAY STREWN IN THE CENTER. THERE IS A GROUP OF GRIM LOOKING MEN AND WOMEN POSITIONED AROUND THE TABLE ON WOOD AND METAL STACKING CHAIRS.SARGEYou know why I called you here. Ya'll are the meanest bunch of miscreants that I have ever had the misfortune to come across, and it pains me to say that this, but your country needs you.BILLSONAgain.Billson chomps a half finished cigar and tips the chair back .SARGEYes Billson. Again. Now I'm not going to beat around the bush. This mission is dangerous. Some of you might not be coming home. There won't be any state funerals for those who don't, and there won't be any medals for those that do.CARLILEWe already ghosts, ain't we. Don't bother me none.Nodding and grunts of acknowledgement from around the table.SARGEOkay, okay. Before we get to the briefing, I do have one issue I would like addressed.BILLSONSarge, you're really going to question me and my team. After Tokyo, after Berlin, after Montreal?SARGENow I know that your team has a solid track record with these kinds of Ops. I know that you will do what needs doing to get the job done. That's not the problem. I just have one question.ZHANG(clearly annoyed)Spit it out.SARGEWhere is the battle wagon.Team shoot confused looks at each other.Billson raises a hand to settle the team down.BILLSONThe what?SARGEThe battle wagon.Team continues to look confused. They have no idea what the sergeant is talking about.SARGEIn Zaragosa. The van you welded armor panels and machineguns to and used to break into the arms dealers fortress.ZHANGOh, the Steel Zephyr. He's talking about the Steel Zephyr. Yeah. Had to ditch it in the Ebro.SARGEOkay, so why is it in the river?CARLILEHad tae douse it to deactivate the Super C-4 strapped to the bottom, didn't we.TIMMINS(points a mocking thumb at Sarge)Sounds like he never had to drown some Super C-4. I suppose that's why you hire the experts.SARGEAlright. Fair enough. Bottom of the Ebro. So where's the one you built out of a train engine in Dhaka.ZHANGThe Light Rail Ravager! Oh, I miss her. Really packed a punch and extra roof space for the missile racks.SARGEAnd where is it? In the river?BILLSONLake.Sarge shakes his head for a moment.SARGEDo you folks see my problem.BILLSONNot really Sarge. Speak plain and we'll see what we can do for you.SARGEHow many missions did you run for us last year?BILLSONTimmins?TIMMINS17 Boss. If you count the Federico twins as 2.SARGESure. 17. And how many battle wagons did you build?Timmins considers for a moment.TIMMINSIncluding the Steel Zephyr?SARGEYes. All the battle wagons.ZHANGCan we stop calling them battle wagons. They got names.SARGEFine. How many.TIMMINS18SARGEYou didn't even run that many missions.ZHANGBuilt two in Daegu. Carlile had his own.CARLILEOnly 'cause Timmins said I had the Kimchi farts and I didnea.SARGEYou built a battle-Zhang pulls a sour look.SARGEOkay, okay. I don't care why. Do any of you know what one of those monstrosities costs?CARLILEWell we don't buy 'em. We build 'em, don't we.SARGEI buy them. I pay for them. Every time I hire you for a mission I pay the expenses. Armor plating, cannon shells, caltrops, arc welders. I have to bury all your battle wagons in secret budgets and military slush funds. By the way, why do you need a new arc welder every time? Why don't you use the old one?BILLSONI think we are all missing the bigger picture here. We ran 18 Ops-TIMMINS17.BILLSON17 Ops. Every single one of them a resounding success.SARGEIn Tampa you drove a Russian fighter jet through a mall.TIMMINSYou sent us that jet.SARGEYes. Because I thought you were going to fly it. You turned it into a tank!BILLSONWe saved the world from Moloch and his global terrorists.SARGEWhere is it now?TIMMINSThe mall?SARGEThe battle wagon! Where is it now.ZHANGThe Suffering Butterfly.SARGEWhat?ZHANGThat's her name. The Suffering Butterfly.SARGEI don't care! Where is it?ZHANGIn the bay. I couldn't let Moloch get her.SARGECould you have used the battle wagon from Tokyo to stop Moloch?The team is confused again.CARLILEShe's in the bay, isn't she.SARGEIf she wasn't in the bay. Imagine just once that you reused a battle wagon. Again. On the next mission. Could you have used that battle wagon to stop Moloch.BILLSON(bewildered by the idea of it)I mean, it's possible, but how would we even have gotten it out of the water?SARGEIt was a hovercraft! I don't even know how you sank it.CARLILEWeren't easy. We're very good at our jobs.SARGEAlright, alright. The current mission is time critical. We only have 24 hours to get you in and get those hostages out. We can talk about this more when you get back.(Sarge shuffles through some maps and pulls one to the top)We have possible entry and extraction points here and here. Known tangos are here, here, and here.BILLSON(leaning back in the chair again)No need Sarge. Me and the team already worked out the plan on the way over here. All we need from you is an attack helicopter and the biggest set of tractor tires you can find.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tMore story work going on here.&nbsp;I have discovered a character that I complete forgot about, because their big scene didn't happen until now. I could go back through and write them in where they need to go, but I'm still working under the advice of so many writers to resist the urge to edit and revise until after I have the whole story written. I jump back all the time and add little notes for new scenes and changes to scenes in *chapter* 1,2 and 3, but so far I haven't significantly revised them. It makes sense now why that is the common wisdom among people who write longer fiction. The problem is, your brain just can't hold all the ideas that make up a good story at one time. I forgot a whole character. One that I have notes for and the bones of an arc for. As I was writing each scene, that character just didn't fire anything in my memory. I like to plan a bit and 'pants' a bit when writing because I like to know where the story is going, but i also like being surprised when characters do or say something I wasn't expecting. That also means that you run the risk of not remembering to write in a whole character. Nothing like learning by doing I guess.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Tony Hawk&rsquo;s Pro SkaterThe first video game, depending on who you ask, was probably a sports game. Either tennis or ping pong. Video games have been infatuated with simulations of real world sports since day one. Only one problem. That doesn&rsquo;t work at all.Video games depicting sports don&rsquo;t really simulate playing them. Tennis you play with your whole body. Everything is taxed. Your muscles, your reflexes, your perception, your decision making skills. All of your various interconnected systems have to be firing for you to play tennis. When, like Pong,&nbsp;you reduce that down to twisting a knob, tilting a stick, or pressing some buttons, it isn&rsquo;t tennis, but it is still fun.The fun part of most sports isn&rsquo;t the mechanics of movement. It isn&rsquo;t the competition, or the camaraderie. It&rsquo;s solving tiny problems over and over and over again. Hitting a ball mid flight, taking a step on uneven terrain, anticipating the next quarter second of play on the field. These are the moments that fun is made of. Our brains just can&rsquo;t get enough of solving these tiny problems. Like a positive reinforcement loop that keeps us practicing potential survival skills until we get good at them. It&rsquo;s a dopamine thing. Pong gets it.Skateboarding at a high level is something that an infinitesimal amount of people have done or will ever do. It&rsquo;s a set of skills that require intense practice and a deep time commitment. The positive feedback loop on skateboarding must be amazing. I don&rsquo;t really know though, since I can barely ride a skateboard over a level surface for more than a few meters. The last time I legitimately gave it a go, I was probably 13. I would hazard a guess that the majority of the audience for the Tony Hawk&rsquo;s Pro Skater games falls into this category. So how does a sport that almost no one has any real world experience with become one of the most popular video games ever? The developers, Neversoft, took a page out of the Pong playbook. They&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t try to simulate skateboarding. Not even close. They weren&rsquo;t even in the same room as a simulation. Instead they focused on getting their players to solve tiny problems over and over and over. Every time you steer the character you are planning half a second into the future. Every time your character hits a ramp you have to predict how much time you will have in the air and choose tricks accordingly. Every time you land a trick you have to be setting up for the next one. The tiny problems never stop.Solving these tiny problems can be fun, but skateboarding, real skateboarding, is a demanding challenge of balance and dexterity, momentum and reactions. If Neversoft had tried to simulate skateboarding it would have resulted in some horrifying set of finger contortions that might be fun to some people, but not to most. Instead, almost every interaction with a Tony Hawk game is biased toward success. Every time you direct your character up a quarter pipe, they will always come down in the perfect position to land the jump. Every time you leap over a rail or ledge and press the button to grind, your skater will magnetically snap to the right position. With very little practice you can land any jump or ride any rail. You only start to crash when you push a grind too long or pack too many tricks into your available airtime. The game wants you to win. It set you up to solve all of those small problems. You reaching for more is where it gets challenging.Tony Hawk&rsquo;s Pro Skater understands fun, and that is why it is one of the best games. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI wanted to take a short break from fiction to write about machines. Well one machine. No, not one machine, a lot of machines. More to the point, my relationship to machines. With machines? Whatever. I&rsquo;ll start over.I like machines. I like the way they work. I like ones that move in consistent and predictable ways. I like machines that use a few repeatable motions to accomplish a variety of tasks. I like to take them apart and put them back together. I like to diagnose problems with machines and fix them. I like knowing that when I take them apart, I can put them back together. I like it when I can put them back together and they still work. I like it when I diagnose a problem with a machine, take it apart then put it back together again, but with one small tweak that gets it humming along.So here is what made me think of all this.I was running the 3d printer again recently. It&rsquo;s important at this point to know that 3d printers are very twitchy, uncooperative machines that are tough to dial in and tough to keep tuned. That goes triple for mine. Mine is a cheap build it yourself kit with a knockoff control board, and issues with some of the electrical connectors. Other than all that, it usually works. At least it works if I don&rsquo;t want to use the usb port or try to update it. Like I said, knockoff control board.I hadn&rsquo;t had it running for a while, because I bought a new board to replace the one that came with it, but as with the rest of the printer, some assembly is required. Also, the new board is just that, a circuit board. Actually it&rsquo;s a set of circuit boards, but either way it has no case, the mounting holes on the printer don&rsquo;t fit it, and the display for it is completely different than the one I have. If I want to use this new board I will need something to put it in or attach it to.Lucky for me I have just the tool for making a new control board case. A 3D printer. That means limping the old board along for a while until I can get one printed. This was a task that I wasn&rsquo;t looking forward to. Mostly because I was scared of it. If the old board flamed out before I got the case done, or further along, if I installed the new board and it didn&rsquo;t work, I would have gone from a potentially working printer, to a definitely not working printer. I had Schrodinger&rsquo;s printer. Turning it on was just too frightening. I had something else to print, so finally I just said screw it and fired the thing up. There was a lot of tuning and adjusting to do to get it running properly, but in less than two hours I had it printing. Of course that wasn&rsquo;t going to last.One failed print later, the heater block that melts the filament was leaking molten plastic, there was a short at the board that stopped one of the print axis from moving, and the extruder wasn&rsquo;t extruding. I felt very disappointed.On the other hand, I really like machines. Now that the printer wasn&rsquo;t working at all, I had no fear of disassembling the thing to try to find out why. I fixed the extruder, since it turns out it was never assembled properly in the first place. That wasn&rsquo;t my fault, the thing just came like that. I cleared the mess of half extruded plastic from the nozzle, and after a lot of fiddling tightened everything to stop the leak in the heater block. I should probably replace that too though, since this one is a bit of a mess.The only thing left was the short at the control board. At first I thought that the board had finally given it all up and I would have to replace it. I left the printer and thought about how I would install the new board. Something about how it had failed didn&rsquo;t seem right. If the board went I should lose more than one axis. I went back and had a look at all the connections running to and from the motors. Sure enough, the board had failed, but it wasn&rsquo;t any of the chips, it was the contacts that the wires run into. I disconnected the motor in question and re connected it to route around the issue. After turning it back on, everything ran perfectly. Well not perfectly, but as well as it did before. So now I have one more print to finish up and I can start making a new case for a new control board. I don&rsquo;t know if it will ever print perfectly, but it should at least print properly. This whole story might sound like a hassle, and it sort of was and still is. The thing about me is, I really like machines. I like it when they work correctly, but I like it even more when I get to take them apart, fix them, and then put them back together again. I know that isn&rsquo;t everyone's thing. I know that isn&rsquo;t even a lot of peoples thing. In a room full of people there might be two who really want to take the room apart. They want to see inside the walls and figure out how the whole thing works. Of those two people, there might be one who wants to put the room back together, exactly the same, like nothing ever happened, but with one screw hidden under the drywall tightened half a turn. I&rsquo;m that guy.I apologize to anyone who has to deal with me, because it must be infuriating. What can I say. I like machines. I have a microwave here that is on the fritz. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m touching that one.\t\t"

I think it's approaching something like a final form. I could probably dive back into anything I have written, disassemble it and improve it, but I think this one is close enough to done that I even gave it a title. You can read This&nbsp;, a short character study about a man with a truly terrible super power.On the longer story front (still no title) I was pretty hung up on one scene. I wrote the stuff around it to try to have it make some sense, but nothing I did made it work right. I wrote about 600 words, deleted that, wrote another 1000 or so and still the whole scene sucked. Finally, after thinking about it for a couple days, I deleted the whole thing and replaced it with a couple of lines. It will need an edit pass, like everything else, but I already like it so much better.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - LandmakerA few years before developing Landmaker, Taito released Puzzle Bobble, one of the best action puzzle games ever made (which I, sort of, wrote about here). The shadow of Puzzle Bobble is immense. It&rsquo;s hardly any wonder that Landmaker gets overlooked when people are compiling lists of the finest puzzle games of all time. Is it as criminally overlooked as Uo Poko or Puzz Loop? Probably not, but still Landmaker deserves a place in our collective memory.Released in 1998, Landmaker takes the color matching puzzle game and gives it a unique twist. Instead of matching blocks to clear them, you match the blocks to make increasingly mammoth structures. Firing a block with the same color at the leading point of one of these structures will dissolve it and any other matched blocks touching it. If you thought all of that sounds sort of familiar, you wouldn&rsquo;t be too far wrong. On the surface Landmaker operates like a lot of other color matching puzzle games. You could try to play it like that, clearing any blocks you can as soon as you are able, but from level 2 on that would be a short road to a game over.Landmaker doesn&rsquo;t want you to clear those blocks. In fact building them up into monolithic chunks of similar color is more valuable. You see Landmaker is competitive by design. If you aren&rsquo;t facing off against another player your rival is a deviously difficult AI. The playstation version of the game has a single player puzzle mode, but the less said about that the better. Landmaker is designed to be played competitively, and the only way to get an edge on your opponent is to build bigger and bigger things before smashing them down. The larger the collection of buildings you destroy on your side, the more junk will rain down on theirs.Then there are the special blocks. Instead of granting the player a bonus as soon as you clear a larger area, Landmaker drops the specials right there on the board. You can shoot a block at them to activate them, but until you do they will sit there on your board, taking up space and being a general pain in the ass. It&rsquo;s the ultimate risk reward mechanic. How many games make your success a potential liability that you have to plan for. It might sound frustrating, but actually it&rsquo;s brilliant.When all is said and done, Landmaker is a fairly simple game, but so is checkers. Similarly, the true depth of Landmaker doesn&rsquo;t start to unfurl until you have played a few games of it. Pretty soon you will start to look for ways to slide blocks behind other blocks, or leave some garbage blocks right up at the edge of your failure line so that you can build larger structures somewhere else. It doesn&rsquo;t just reward speed. Planning two or three blocks ahead can unleash a greater assault on the other player than simply clearing everything that comes down the board at you.Landmaker is one of the best games with one of the best names. Don&rsquo;t take my word for it. You should probably just play it, or watch this video.       \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\thttps://globalgamejam.org/2019/games/my-neighbour-vampire&#8203;More than 46,000 people in 114 countries got together to make games this weekend. I was one of them.&nbsp;Over the past 9 years I have joined up with teams and filled all different rolls. I have made 3D models, painted textures, drawn concepts, and programmed game features. I think this is the first time I only focused on one task. This year I drew and painted portraits.&nbsp;The game we made is a visual novel style jokey adventure story. It required a lot of writing and a number of characters. My job was drawing images of the weird cast of characters in the script.I decided to attempt a cartoony line art and flat color style. This is not the way that I usually work and a very different style that I'm not very comfortable with, but that is the joy of the Global Game Jam for me. The time pressure is&nbsp;&nbsp;high (you only have 48 hours), but the stakes are very low (failing is part of the process), so you might as well try something new. You don't really have time to overthink it.&nbsp;I started out by heavily overthinking it, which meant the first character I made isn't very good. The second character is literally a palette swap of the first, but that is a joke in the script. After I got that out of my system and just started drawing oddballs everything went much smoother.&nbsp;All in all, it was a fun, relatively stress free weekend, and I added a few new tools to my arsenal.&nbsp;Here are the characters I made, but I think they work better with the dialog, so you should probably download the game and play through it a couple of times. It's fairly short, but it includes some randomization and a lot of branching paths to follow.&nbsp;Thank you to the team that built My Neighbour the Vampire.

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Marble MadnessMarble Madness is a game that probably shouldn&rsquo;t exist. I mean, obviously it does. People made it. The odds are pretty good &nbsp;Mark Cerny and Bob Flanagan made it sometime before it&rsquo;s release, in 1984. At least that is what history says. Even playing it today, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine some form of time travel wasn&rsquo;t involved.I invite you to survey the landscape of video games in 1984. A lot of really great games were created or released that year. Tetris, Excitebike, Elite, 1942, King&rsquo;s Quest; true classics. But no game in 1984 compares to the technical wizardry of Marble Madness. Until the advent of full 3d game engines and physics systems a decade later, nothing even came close.In most ways, Marble Madness is 1984 as hell. We were only 2 years off of Tron and hot on the heels of The Adventures of Andre and Wally B., a short film by an offshoot Lucasfilm division that would later become PIXAR. Smooth, shiny CG graphics and topographical grids had never been more in fashion. Limitations of the time meant the the graphics in Marble madness had to be composed of chunky pixels, but they certainly did all they could to feel like that glossy rendered CG stuff.It is the movement that really sets Marble Madness apart from its contemporaries. The trackball controlled marble on the screen moves like something from the future. It&rsquo;s future. Our past. Listen, I&rsquo;m not a time traveller so I don&rsquo;t know how this stuff works, but I do know that Marble Madness controls and moves like nothing else of it&rsquo;s era. The marble travels with a weight and accuracy that you can feel when you play it. Counteracting the momentum of a steep requires a natural, instinctive series of inputs. Small touches on the trackball connect you to the on screen world in a very physical way. Ports of the game would go on to use gamepads and joysticks slightly muting the effect of controlling a rolling marble, but somehow the feeling of accurate physical movement still holds on most platforms. Probably an artifact of whatever future tech was used to concoct the game.In many ways Marble Madness falls short as a game. It is not very long and ramps up the difficulty from flat to vertical wall in about 60 seconds. Sometimes the orthographic view angle makes it difficult to tell where things are in the levels. On the other hand, the music is absolutely bangin. So, I was wrong before, this game is actually fantastic.If you&rsquo;re looking for a taste of the future, well the future from the perspective of 1984, you should probably play Marble Madness. It&rsquo;s one of the best games.       \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\t&nbsp;still banging away in the word mines over here.&nbsp;Hard to believe that I have been writing here, once a week, for over 6 years. I started a blog to describe game development, then I expanded that to writing about games and other things on a regular schedule just to practice writing. One day another game developer suggested participating in NaNoWriMo&nbsp;and I was baffled. I mean I was writing every week, but writing a novel would mean writing fiction and that wasn't what I did. He might as well have said 'You drive a car. Why don't you fly this jet.' In my mind the two could not have been more distant. Now I have 8 small stories on my site (about a dozen more that never made it that far) and another thing that started as a short story but is nearing the end of 'episode 1' and couldn't fairly be called short. Every new page of words still feels like a genuine effort to string together, but I haven't grown weary of it. I can feel some incremental improvement, but I still don't think that I am done practicing. Maybe after an even dozen years I'll feel like I know how to write. I doubt it. Until then, I'll see if I can write something that I think other people might want to read.\t\t"

It's sort of funny the sorts of things that you don't even know a scene is missing until you write the things that follow them up. There are a few descriptions and conversations that I need to tie back into part 1 here to sell stuff further down the road. The one positives of writing something like this more or less in public is that I have to break myself of ever finding any one scene or line too precious. The second I post it up, a lot of it isn't mine anymore, if that makes any sense. The previous warnings stand; you can read it if you want, but things are likely to change when editing happens. On the other hand, if you do read it, you can tell me what you like, or more importantly what you don't like and I can add that too the list of things that will get looked at and revised when I go back over it.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis - The opening creditsThe exact second that video games became a lucrative artform, someone signed a movie tie in deal. Video games became a vehicle to advertise. Movies, TV shows, toys, candy, rock bands, clothing brands, and fast food restaurants all have video game tie ins. The overwhelming majority of them are terrible. Just like a book often doesn&rsquo;t translate to film very well, most properties don&rsquo;t make for great video games. It isn&rsquo;t because it&rsquo;s impossible to translate them, it&rsquo;s usually because what makes artwork good in one medium doesn&rsquo;t always carry over into another. With a deft enough hand, and a solid understanding of the medium, sometimes properties can shine on multiple fronts. When Lucasfilm started an internal video game development studio (LucasArts) it was really only a matter of time before they started making games based on their films. Luckily for the world, the rights to create games based on Lucasfilm movies were tied up in deals with Atari. This left the game developers at LucasArts little choice but to come up with their own ideas, their own games, and their own style. When it came time to create games based on Lucasfilm movies internally, they had already created their own game design language (figuratively and literally). When they started work on Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis the LucasArts style of storytelling adventure game was several titles in and resonated strongly with players. They knew that games weren&rsquo;t movies and that the medium asked different things of the material. The opening shot of Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis sees Indy crashing through the window into what looks like a dusty tomb full of relics and artifacts. In a voice that very obviously isn&rsquo;t Harrison Ford but still feels like Indy, he asks himself how he&rsquo;s going to &lsquo;find that statue in all this junk&rsquo;. The stage is set instantly. We know there is an adventure underway and that it involves finding a treasure. Something seems a little off. This room is slightly too organized and sorted to be a tomb, but we carry on. If you hover your mouse over objects labels pop up and clicking sends Indy over to comment on the artifact you have selected. The game begins teaching you how to play it immediately and with no &lsquo;How to Play&rsquo; preamble. Like an adventure, it just goes.Eventually clicking on a particular statue causes Indy to fall and lay stunned a floor below. This room is even more odd. Brighter, more organized. Tidy shelves line the walls. An obvious passage leads down to an even brighter room. Introductory titles and credits continue to play across the screen letting you know that you are very much in the opening scenes.When you direct Indy to climb down the rope to the brightly lit area, instead of a graceful action hero descent, he tips a statue over and crashes down another floor. This time he has fallen into a fairly standard looking library. Brightly lit by the sun streaming through large windows. Outside is a pleasant summer day. What you were initially meant to believe was a tomb raiding adventure seems to be nothing of the sort. As the intro concludes, it is revealed that Indy has just broken into his own university to find something he or his colleague Marcus had misplaced. After swinging through a closed window, knocking over several priceless artifacts, smashing through the ceiling of one floor and rolling down a coal chute, he simply walks across the street to the building housing his office. Indy then immediately gets into a fist fight with a Nazi. This is the sort of game you are playing. This is the Indiana Jones of this world. He is constantly in adventure mode even when doing something mundane, and this game is self aware enough to know that the entire premise&nbsp;is silly.The tone of the movies is captured without any attempt to ape the actual structure of a film. You came to play a game and a certain amount of that is suspending disbelief and reveling in the absurd. You might wander Indy around the same area for 45 minutes with no idea what to do, or struggle to solve a puzzle that is just a little to obtuse, but the game makes it clear that it isn&rsquo;t because Indy is an idiot, this is just how game worlds work. The game lets you know all of this before the opening credits are over.If you continue to play (and you will want to, this is a great game) the same tone is reinforced again and again. The characters and original ideas for this game might come from a movie, but this is a video game and the medium works differently. Interaction comes first. Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis is one of the best games with maybe the best opening credits of any game.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI can&rsquo;t remember a time when I didn&rsquo;t read comics. I know there were a few early years there when I didn&rsquo;t read at all, but as soon as I could sound out words, I was reading comics. I know that there must have been comics I read before this, but the first comic I remember, story beats, lines of dialog, images emblazoned on my memory, was Fantastic Four #210. We lived on a farm so going to the store meant driving several miles. At least 10-20 minutes of sitting in a hot Chevy Impala. For a kid who was probably 4 at the time, that might as well have been forever. I would get fidgety and squirm and complain. I probably pushed my mom to the brink on some of those trips. I always had toys and books in the car, but they must not have made an impact because I can&rsquo;t recall most of them. What I do remember is the day that my mom bought me Fantastic Four #210.On the cover was an enormous man draped in layers of blue and purple technology floating in space. Not a realistic depiction of space, the 1970s sci fi version of space. The kind of space with several multi colored planets and comets blazing past. You know, that good space. Being a kid addicted to all things space and robots and lasers, this comic was off to a great start. The first page is an image of Ben Grimm (The Thing) and Sue Storm (Invisible Woman) standing on top of a spaceship deflecting asteroids, Ben with a futuristic looking piece of metal ripped away from the ship and Sue with invisible force fields she controlled with her mind. The second page has a talking robot. I must have read that comic a thousand times.There are two scenes that I still remember vividly from that comic. Johnny Storm (the Human Torch) attempts to save his friend Ben but botches it and ends up hurling himself into the vacuum of space. Instead Ben ends up saving Johnny by hauling him back inside the ship and performing artificial respiration. The other is when the entire Fantastic Four attempt to get Galactus&rsquo;s attention by hitting him, burning him, and trashing his ship only to have him ignore them and undo all of their damage with a wave of his hand. Reed Richards decides that force won&rsquo;t work on Galactus and they will have to try to outsmart him. By the end of the issue it certainly looks like they have failed at that too. I had seen and read superhero stories before then. I had watched many episodes of the old animated Spider-man show. I might have even read a Marvel comic before then. What I hadn&rsquo;t been introduced to was watching these magnificently powerful characters fail, and fail in very dumb human ways. I had no idea who Galactus was before that comic, but I knew from the buildup that trying to hit that huge purple guy was never going to accomplish anything. The Fantastic Four knew it too, but they tried to hit him anyway. They tried everything and failed. The last page isn&rsquo;t even really a cliffhanger. The Fantastic Four simply get sent off by Galactus on their next adventure. The entire story is just about that team of people, that family, pushing forward stumbling over obstacles but never ever giving up. The heroism wasn&rsquo;t about winning, it was about never allowing losing to stop them. It was about holding each other together through insurmountable adversity. This story was something different than I was used to. It wasn&rsquo;t about the adventure. It was about those characters dealing with the adventure. It was about a family suffering and still carrying on together.Stan Lee didn&rsquo;t write this story, the great writer Marv Wolfman did, but it follows the template that Stan Lee had laid out. Stories are about characters and characters are people. People do human things, good things, bad things, dumb things, heroic things, and they often do all of them at the same time. Stories aren&rsquo;t about the plot, stories are about people reacting to all the plot happening around them. Thrilling adventure stories with superheroes certainly, but at their core, every Marvel comic &nbsp;was filled with stories about people. Often they were stories about marginalized people and folks on the edges of society. For the most part, Marvel characters aren&rsquo;t dashing heroes and infallible paragons. They are bookish teens and kids hiding from persecution. People forced to deal with abilities they didn&rsquo;t want or ask for. There are an awful lot of Marvel stories about being broke. Spider-man doesn&rsquo;t have kryptonite, he has student loans. &#8203;I can honestly say that the only reason you are reading this right now, the only reason I have ever written anything is because of great writers like like Marv Wolfman and Stan Lee. I learned to draw because of comics and I write because of comics. I write because of the love I had for those stories.Once, many years ago, I wrote the only fan letter I have ever written. I sent it to Stan Lee, or at least the address on his web site. It was only one sentence long. I wrote &ldquo;Thanks for everything.&rdquo;He probably never saw it, but that&rsquo;s fine. I didn&rsquo;t really write it for him. I wrote it for that kid sitting in the back of a hot car reading an issue of Fantastic Four or Xmen or Spider-man for the &nbsp;thousandth time. To him those stories were everything.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - DoomDoom is probably in the top ten on lists of the most popular video games of all time. You don&rsquo;t have to check, I already did and it is. That means that if you are reading this you have almost certainly heard of Doom. There is a fair to good chance you have played Doom. Quite a few of you have played a lot of Doom and you might have played it on a lot of different hardware using a variety of input devices. You might have played a modded version of Doom with new graphics and sounds stolen directly from your favourite franchises. You may have played Doom clones that felt so similar but so very different. What I&rsquo;m getting at is, Doom needs no introduction. Also, Doom doesn&rsquo;t need me to tell people how good it is. Doom is doing just fine.None of this series has ever been about promoting games that people already like. It has always been about advocating for good things in general, and in the specific case of video games, exploring what it was that made them good in the first place.Almost every review, promotion, and reverie about Doom will talk about its fast pace and enjoyable action. They will talk about the power fantasy and the cartoonishly horrific themes. The heavy metal album cover feel of the world. The satisfying impacts and throaty sound design. All of these are true, but none of them are why Doom is so fondly remembered.Doom is a different place. There had been 3D games before Doom and games that were played from a first person perspective. Flight simulators were very popular at the time. Some of them were fun and a lot of them did right by the first person perspective. Doom was the first game that felt like it took place in a different world than our own. It&rsquo;s the difference between watching a recording or representation of another place on a screen or looking at that other place through a window. Starting with Doom, the illusion was complete. An entirely different world sat on the other side of that window. More importantly, you could position that window anywhere you wanted. You could move it through that world. You could recognize the places in that world, not as mazes to be solved but as real and solid and distinct. Places with specific architecture and residents. Places with secrets hidden just around the corner.I will stop short of saying that you felt like you were there, in the hell world of doom, but you felt like you could be. It was real in a way that games had not been. If you were able to connect to other people playing on other computers in this one shared world, Doom went from impressive to absolutely transportational magic. The developers of Doom had created a world that fit onto a floppy disk. You could carry it in your pocket. Any computer could suddenly become a window into that world. Doom didn&rsquo;t have to be an action game to be successful. In fact, it almost wasn&rsquo;t. I doubt that would have mattered. What Doom promised and delivered was another place. That is why Doom is one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - super SprintThere should be no world in which spinning a steering wheel as hard as you can and then grabbing it into a dead stop allows you drive a race car. The front wheels on your average car can only pivot over a small range before they become useless for actually turning. At speed this is even more true. Your steering wheel is nothing like the wheel of some pirates galleon it can't actually turn a full 360. There would be no point to it and it would do nothing to help you with control of the vehicle or feel for the road. Super Sprint requires that you spin that wheel and get good at it. Controlling the ultra slippery cars of Super Sprint is all in the wrist. Well, the wrist, forearm, shoulder, and maybe the hips. Can it be played without throwing a significant amount of your entire body into it? Maybe, but I can&rsquo;t see how that would be fun. Success at Super Sprint requires very physical interaction. The really interesting part is that the interaction you are required to do bears no resemblance to the activity the game is asking you to simulate. What you are doing is nothing like driving, but it feels like driving a race car. Or it feels like what you imagine driving a race car would feel like.So, in my research I couldn&rsquo;t find any technical description of how the software in Super Sprint actually reacted to a player manipulating the wheel. I don&rsquo;t know for sure, but examining it from the outside, it seems like Super Sprint doesn&rsquo;t really care how fast the wheel spins. The cars seem to have a fixed rotation speed coded into them. Spinning the steering wheel faster than that would have no extra effect. What&rsquo;s more, the wheel also has no actual center. It reads rotation clockwise and counterclockwise, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to care what position the wheel starts in. It&rsquo;s only reading rotation left and right. That means that you can spin the wheel left very hard, stop it immediately, and rotate it slightly to the right and the cumulative effect would be that the car would veer sharply left and then instantly center and start turning right. Oversteer does not exist in the physics model of Super Sprint.You don&rsquo;t steer the cars in Super Sprint like you would steer a real car. You steer the cars, speedy, drifty, open wheel race cars, like you feel like you should. Physically, drastically, and with no small amount of style.Super Sprint doesn&rsquo;t even attempt to be an accurate simulation of driving. Instead it tries to recreate how we pretend to drive. The over exaggerated pantomime of winning an F1 race. It&rsquo;s like air guitar with a steering wheel and it does it fantastically. Super Sprint is one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tAfter writing any story comes the second, less fun, but maybe more important part of the process. You have to reread it, edit it, and probably rewrite it. At least you will have to rewrite chunks of it. I posted a story last week that did a lot of what I was intending for it, but felt a little flat around the edges. I had created for myself the problem of writing distinct characters with little or no way to actually emote. There would be no \"Jim felt\" or \"Lisa thought\" in this story. There would be no 'AI develops human personality' in this story. Still, I very definitely&nbsp;wanted these cleaning bots to be distinct characters with their own motivations and personalities. If you get to the end of this story and you don't know how :6b99 'thinks' or 'feels' and you don't see how its personality is affected by the events of the story, then I have failed.&nbsp;I had also created the problem of character that are all referred&nbsp;to as 'it' and all have difficult and jarring names. I needed to make sure that the reader could tell&nbsp;which of the bots was being written about even if you skipped over the names and didn't really register them (I skip them almost every time I read it).&nbsp;The first pass, I didn't think really solved all of these problems and may or may not have invoked an empathetic reaction in a reader. May or may not, as you can probably guess, is not really what you should be going for in story telling. Much of the writing is a little too dispassionate&nbsp;and technical as well. It suits the characters, but it's alienating to the humans who actually read stories.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dumbing down a story or&nbsp;being unsubtle&nbsp;with a point isn't really what I was going for either. I think the knew changes bring the story closer to what I had imagined.&nbsp;Let me know what you think. Better? or should I go back in for another round of rewrites?Early morning sunlight plunged down constructed canyons catching in the corners. Tall lines of silver and gold marking the silhouette edges of towering structures. Buildings with cores of wood and stone, bound in skins of steel and glass, adorned with effervescent films and baubles of diamond and silicone. Buildings cocooned in all the eras they had persisted through. The stratified clothing of times past. All of these layers humming with the constant flow of electricity and light. A city roused awake like a forest opening toward morning.All of it an illusion of course. The city was always awake. Always alert. Always buzzing and moving and breathing with activity. The city, to its memory, had never rested. Even now, before the most active portions of the day, small tendrils of the city flicked and darted to clean and polish and organize. Each one an independent player in an orchestra of activity.Sliding briskly along a tiled floor, a minuscule cleaning bot (designated d232:bd2c:c34a:c385:f487:d5bc:af34:6b99 V12.4) attempted to polish away a patch of grime. Its compact energetic body had managed to scrub more than three-quarters of the floor in the last hour before sunrise. It paused ever so briefly to consider time. it would need to revise its pathing plan if it intended to keep to its desired schedule. It had never slipped on its schedule. It had recently reduced the accepted levels of cleanliness in its plan by a full percentage point to increase the pace. :6b99 put a very high priority on keeping to the schedule.For most of its service cycle :6b99 had worked together with a team. Its main counterpart (designated d232:bd2c:c34a:c385:f487:d5bc:af34:d1b8 V8.7) had slowed significantly in the last few days. The adhesive coating on one of its drive wheels had been peeled away by a rough patch of aluminum edging. Now it would spend an unacceptable portion of an activity period spinning on the spot, unable to overcome the friction generated by its cleaning brushes. Every so often the damaged drive wheel would catch and :d1b8 would make a few solid laps of the kitchen. Every cycle the cleaning bots would engage in a few nanoseconds of organisational communications. Typically this meant that they would share potential schedules and planned routes, or offer each other new predictions for changes in the kitchens menu. The prep, chef, and server bots never shared their predictions for the menu. Tastes and requests were always changing and they had determined that offering predictions to the cleaning bots impacted their efficiency. :6b99 had recently purged the archived memory of a communication with a server bot. It still held onto the timestamped record that a communication occurred, but the content of that communication was lost to the ether. :d1b8 assured :6b99 during the evening communications that it was adjusting the timing of its damaged wheel and was testing patterns that would help to keep it on schedule. It also suggested that the current cleaning cycle could be extended slightly to keep up a maximum level of cleanliness. They both made note of the minor differences in their plans and schedules. :d1b8 suggested a test period of no less than 8 cycles to see if they could balance out their goals. :6b99 agreed but privately flagged the schedule as a red level high priority.A day later, over an inactive cycle meant for recharging, :6b99 assessed and concluded that :d1b8 was slowing the entire cleaning time by more than thirty-six minutes. It quickly sent a request up to the Local Operation Management System. :d1b8 should, it requested, be repaired or recycled to restore the schedule. LOMS responded almost instantly. Resources, it said, were not yet available for a full recycle but a repair would be attempted soon. :6b99 also sent a message to :d1b8 that it should send requests for repair or recycle to LOMS itself to improve efficiency in the future. :d1b8 had not replied.Shafts of pale gold danced off drifting particles. Early morning sunlight angled itself through the newly opened metal shutters and into the kitchen. Stone countertops worn into shallow bowls from constant use glistened as sunbeams slowly swept the room. Soon there would be a whirring of activity as the kitchen hummed to life, but for now only two small ,buzzing shapes presented any sign of life.:6b99 finished with the spot of dirt it was working on, marking it as visually 73% cleaner. Standard settings would demand the visual cleanliness of any single patch of floor be 80% or higher. On this schedule, 73% would have to stand as an acceptable minimum. It rounded the corner of a counter and narrowly avoided a collision with :d1b8. The hobbled bot had come up against a kick plate and was trying to break free of a groove in the tile floor by repeatedly lurching forward and backward. With the counter in the way, it was having trouble generating any speed. :6b99 made a deft juke to the left to avoid the other bot and continued on its way. It stored a quick note to send another request to LOMS during its inactive cycle.:6b99 spent most of the lunch rush nestled into its recharging station against the back wall. The tall slender forms of prep and serving bots zipped about the room ignorant of its presence. Chef bots slid back and forth along the length of the counters, chopping, stirring, combining ingredients much as they always did. &nbsp;:6b99 noticed one small change to the central prep bots routine as it adjusted to an uncommon recipe. LOMS or COMS must have sent a request down to the prep bots that the market of preferred tastes had changed. As old recipes fell out of favour, at least one new recipe always took its place. New recipes meant new plans, but prep, chef, and server bots never publicly filed their plans or made them accessible to the cleaning bots. They had decided that informing cleaning bots of minor changes would impact efficiency. If LOMS was in the loop, that information never made its way down to the cleaning bots. :6b99 chose to get ahead of the problem and reworked its plan for the next cycle. The small change would mean a fair bit of time saved since it was harder to clean the floor where the prep bots had worn through the tile to the concrete below. The central prep bots new path took it over a relatively unused patch of smooth tile. With the new plan confirmed :6b99 took a moment to reduce power usage and charge more efficiently for the next cycle.The sound of :d1b8 being dragged across the tile by the eastern server bot sent an alert up to LOMS and back down to every bot in the local network. :6b99 sparked back up to full power mode, ready to deal with any immediate mess. It watched as :d1b8 caught on the chipped corner of a tile and was sent scuttling off into the wall. It bounced off with a dull clunk and spun wildly along the baseboards. It finally settled in the corner, upside down on a pile of filth that their rounded bodies could never quite reach. Once there had been a third cleaning bot (designated d232:bd2c:c34a:c385:f487:d5bc:af34:361b V2.0). It had been responsible for the corners and under the ovens. :361b had three extendible brushes that it would use to deal with places the other two couldn&rsquo;t reach. It had broken two brushes in one cleaning cycle and received only one of the replacement brushes it had requested from LOMS. LOMS had forwarded a reply from COMS stating that resources were not yet available and the second brush would be delayed.:361b altered its pathing and plan to clean with two brushes. :db99 had been forced to reroute its own path to accommodate :361b. The cycle was slowed slightly, but cleanliness was maintained to a high standard.Every day during communications :361b would inform the other two of the state of its brushes and any communications it had with LOMS about them. It kept very detailed records on the quality of the bristles, any nicks or scratches to the extendible spines. :361b would request that one of the other two bots conduct a quick visual inspection of any part of the brushes that it couldn&rsquo;t examine on its own. The other two would occasionally comply, but they would more often decline citing a lack of available time in their schedule or a desire to maintain a high energy efficiency or a need to keep communication channels clear and not clogged with image and video traffic. :db99 had been powered down when :361b had broken its third and last brush. :361b often ran at slightly different times than the other two to keep to its own schedule. When the next cycle started :db99 found :361b sitting idle in the middle of the floor. It had moved into the usual path of one of the server bots and sat, powered but idle. When :db99 had sent it a message requesting that it move off to the side and contact LOMS, :361b had actively ignored the request. :db99 decided to push :361b out of the way and tucked it neatly under one of the stoves. It readjusted its cleaning plan to account for the newly inaccessible spots. Corners and unreachable areas would have to receive a lower priority.Laying on its back wedged into a sedimentary buildup of grease and cut ends of rotting vegetables :d1b8 made vain attempts to wriggle it&rsquo;s way free of the corner. It spun its brushes and ran its one good drive wheel in oscillating patterns. The self-righting mechanism seemed to be mired in the grease and mold pressed into the corner.:db99 sent a request to LOMS. LOMS responded that resources were not yet available for a replacement or recycle and a repair would be attempted soon. :db99 quickly adjusted its plan and revised its schedule to minimize recharge time. It also made a note to reduce visual cleanliness if necessary but decided not to factor that into its plan just yet.:db99 paused briefly over a patch of clean floor and considered the speed and impact force required to free :d1b8 from the corner. Ultimately it decided the risk was too high and opted to leave :d1b8 where it was. It also made a quick note to reduce requests to LOMS by 80%. Requests had been negatively impacting efficiency. :db99 spun counterclockwise and headed for small pile of crumbs in an aim to stay on pace.Orange bands of sunset dipped gracefully behind the backs of looming buildings and the small kitchen was briefly dimmed. New hues of purple green and pink splashed across the counters as the artificial lights of city rose to chase away the dark. The city never truly slept. It only dimmed briefly and prepared for the next cycle.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI've continued to slowly rework and refine Adventure Caddie, the once video game, now cooperative board game. Every time I make a major change to the rules I increment the version number so you can see that we are now on version 0.4 . I used to have dice. No more dice. I used to have a competitive&nbsp;version. No more competitive&nbsp;version. I used to have 3 different types of tokens. Now only one. As it gets simpler, I think that hopefully it gets better. I have yet to give it a major play test (with people who aren't me or related to me),&nbsp;but I would have to assume that I will end up incriminating&nbsp;that number a few times after I set up one of those.&nbsp;These are the rules as they stand right now. (not including the overall win/lose conditions since those are still undergoing an overhaul)Adventure Caddie - V. 0.4SetupTurn orderAll Caddies must negotiate the turn order for each adventure round. Hero turn order also determines their position on the field. The Hero in front can only do Melee damage. The Hero in the back can only do ranged damage. Loot is collected and inventory is shuffled in your selected turn order. Choose wisely Caddies.Start RoundHeroes use any potions and consumables they are holding. All of them. If you handed it to them they will drink it. Remove the potions from the Heroes and throw them on the ground.Discard any items on the ground. The Heroes have moved on and you have to move on with them. Wave goodby to those items and sweep them aside. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Attack phaseCaddies get to negotiate the turn order, but every Hero must take a turn. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hero attack - hero base attack value + weapon bonus value&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Heroes like weapons and they like attacking so all weapons a Hero is holding will be used in an attack. Melee weapons hit close ranged enemies. Ranged Weapons hit distant foes.If a weapon can be used melee or ranged the Caddie will have to choose one or the other but not both.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1 unit of Damage is dealt to all weapons held by the hero. Using weapons wears them out.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Any single use weapons are used and then discarded. They aren&rsquo;t thrown to the ground, but moved to the discard pile. They won&rsquo;t be available when the time comes for Caddies to scavenge the field.Melee damage starts at the front of line of enemies and works its way back. If there were a line of 4 enemies and the Hero did 3 melee damage, the first 3 enemies would receive one point to damage each. If, instead, the Hero did 5 melee damage each enemy would receive one point of damage and you would wrap around to the front again dropping the last point of damage on the first enemy.Ranged damage works in the same way, except you start counting out points of damage from the back of the enemy line forward.Remember, the Hero at the front of the line can&rsquo;t use ranged weapons and the Hero at the back of the line can&rsquo;t use melee weapons.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Special Weapon or Hero effects.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Defense PhaseEnemies deal the amount of damage indicated on their card. Melee damage is dealt to the Heroes starting from the front of the line back, Ranged damage is dealt starting from the back of the line forward. The first enemy in the line can only use melee attacks and the back enemy can only use ranged attacks.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Damage is first dealt to armor and defence items. As part of a Caddies expert coaching, they will get to determine what armor or defence item receives damage first during each enemies attack.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If there are no defensive items damage is taken directly to the heroes health. Keep them stocked up on armor, since it&rsquo;s tough to Caddie a dead Hero.Item Drop Phase&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Each Monster defeated drops something. The bag, or bags, that the items are pulled from are marked on the enemy card. If your Hero destroys an enemy on their turn you get to &nbsp;give the bags a shake and pull ,without looking, as many items as is indicated. Put those items on the ground. When any bag is empty refill all of the bags from the discard pile and give them a good shake.Inventory Management / Repair Phase&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Every Caddie, in their Hero turn order can pick up one item from the ground and put it into the pack if there is room available. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After scavenging you can do one of the following&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Move or swap one item or pair of items from the hero to the pack &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Move or swap one item or pair of items within in the pack&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Move or swap one item or pair of items from or to the ground and the pack.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Any damaged items in the pack are repaired for one unit of damage.The enemy has retreated and your Heroes are pressing the attack. No time to rest. You hurry along behind, packs jangling, into the next round of this adventure.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - ExcitebikeWhen you use a clutch on a motorcycle or manual transmission vehicle you have to get a feel for it. A clutch is not a switch that engages or releases instantly. There is a smooth gradient to the motion. You can feel the clutch gradually connect to the rotation of the engine and transfer that power to your tires. There is a point where the friction is enough to provide some motivation for the vehicle to move, but not so much that the engine can&rsquo;t keep up and stalls out. That point is a balance that you can feel.Excitebike is not at all about racing. Excitebike is about balance. The subtle difference between leaning too far forward or too far back. The balance between too much throttle and not enough speed. The balance between avoiding obstacles and deliberately choosing the collisions you can&rsquo;t avoid. Excitebike is all about pushing that balance right up to the tipping point but holding on. Like releasing a clutch, Excitebike is about finding that balance point and riding it until you feel everything start to move as one fluid machine.Excitebike was designed for the original Nintendo Famicom in japan and reconfigured for the NES in the rest of the world. The NES was a capable, but simple computer for the time and all of its inputs were digital on/off yes/no switches. When you pressed a button it was pressed. There was no soft curve of input for the NES. Even though everyone who played the machine would instinctively press the buttons and control pad harder, willing the in game characters to go faster or jump higher, there was just no physical way to do that. It registered all of its inputs as on or off. If you are trying to replicate a feeling of maintaining a tenuous balance with inputs that are all or nothing, what&rsquo;s a game developer to do?Shigeru Miyamoto is arguably the best game designer of all time. At every turn he and his team will design toward intuitive feel over mathematical specificity. They have become adept at turning the binary of on/off controls into something that feels granular and subtle. Something that you feel you can balance.Excitebike uses two separate buttons to control the speed of your on screen dirt bike. On will never push the bike out of balance to the point that it overheats, but it won&rsquo;t push the bike fast enough to get you past the finish line in the allotted time either. The other control revs your engine and pushes the bike faster, but you run the risk of overheating and stalling out. If you stall out you will have to sit by the side of the track for a few beats waiting for the bike to cool down. Using only one button will be too slow, using only the other button will generate too much heat and ultimately be too slow. To complete the timed races successfully you will have to rock your thumb back and forth between the buttons too keep your speed in balance.Every design decision in Excitebike plays out the same way. Completing the jumps on the track requires you to nudge the pad left and right to maximize your jump distance, while still accounting for the stability of your landing. If you get too much distance, you sacrifice speed on the landing. If you pay too much attention to your landing you lose speed on the jump. Adjusting your track position up and down can help you avoid obstacles, but sometimes at the expense of the easier or faster path. When there are other riders on the course, there is no perfect path. You will have to balance your speed with your odds of a crash. The arcade and famicom disk system revisions of the game retitled, VS. Excitebike, add more mechanics, but all of them deal with the push and pull of balance. No matter what version you play, it doesn&rsquo;t take very long before you start sliding smoothly from pressing A to B and back and you start adjusting your bike in the air to land a perfectly smooth jump. Pretty soon, playing Excitebike is just like working a clutch. It&rsquo;s not about speed, it&rsquo;s about maintaining that balance and playing by feel.Excitebike and VS. Excitebike are some of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Missile CommandThere are a lot of games that are tests of endurance. Most early video games had no victory state, no point at which you could say that you had beaten the game. You could play the game until you could not ,or did not want to continue. You could play until the game stopped working, or you ran out of money. Arcade owners were hoping for the last option. It was a competition between you and the game to see which one could last longer. Games with the design sense and basic play cycle of Missile Command were not uncommon. It was a product of the artform and arcade business as it was in 1980. It was also a product of the late stages of the cold war. Art is a reflection of it&rsquo;s time. Surrealism and dadaism in the 1920&rsquo;s sprung from the hyper-rigidity of a europe mechanized to sustain the first world war. It is a release valve of pent up emotion and a rejection of organized logical thought. During this same time there is the rise of art deco and science fiction, art forms that embrace the technological leaps that the war demanded, but repurposed them in the pursuit of aesthetic beauty and optimistic vision. Two very different, very human ways of dealing with the trauma of the preceding decade. During the 1980&rsquo;s, the cold war was coming to a close. One way or another it was going to end and the pervasive anxiety of the hows, whys and whens of that ending fueled a lot of art. Maybe you could say that Missile Command is a little too on the nose. A little too representational and not nearly allegorical enough. Maybe you could say that it was too pessimistic in not including a victory condition. Games are supposed to be fun right? They are supposed to foster joy.Missile Command offers you one choice, Defend these six cities, or don&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s it. The truth is, you can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t. No matter how good you are at the game, no matter how well you use your limited munitions, no matter how well you defend the cities, you will fail. One falling bomb will get through. One attack will succeed. One city and all of its inhabitants will be lost. It will be your fault. The next city will fall. Then the next. They will all be destroyed and there is nothing you can do about it. When you ultimately lose your final city, Missile Command doesn&rsquo;t present the customary Game Over, subtly inviting you to play again. Missile Command says THE END. There is a finality to your failure. You can only delay the inevitable.In 1980 that&rsquo;s how it felt. Inevitable. Not an all out nuclear war, but a change. The change from breathless hostility and geopolitical stasis to something else was inevitable. You just had to have hope that the world would choose a change toward peace. Stability. Art has the luxury of choosing both outcomes, or many outcomes. Art can be surrealist and reject rigid, lock step of progress, but can do it with the wide eyed optimism and hope for the future embodied in science fiction. Both can be true. For some art both must be true.Missile Command is ultimately a positive and optimistic work. Your only job is to defend. You protect your cities, you preserve life. Never are you tasked with attacking an enemy. Never are you asked to destroy. You act as a shield, not a sword. The mechanics and business of the arcade demand that you eventually lose the game, but Missile Command suggests to you that maybe, if you don&rsquo;t lose hope, you will succeed. You will save your cities and outlast the onslaught raining down on you. And maybe, just maybe, no one else has to lose for you to win.If any work of art could so succinctly sum up the frozen emotional turmoil of the early 1980&rsquo;s, it was Missile Command. Missile Command is one of the best games.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - TetrisIt won&rsquo;t be news to anyone that Tetris is one of the best games ever created. Not just video games. Games. All games. Tetris is one of the best Games ever created. Tetris is that good. If the devices exits to play it, tetris will likely be played in much the same form as it is today well into the next century or further. Tetris will persist.Tetris is as good a game as Poker.Video games are a technology driven artform constantly chasing better, more vibrant visuals, sharper fuller audio, more intelligent and challenging adversaries. All of this progress demands new programs and techniques and new silicon for those programs to run on. Tetris, by contrast, is an experience driven work of art. To Tetris players the look and sound of the game doesn&rsquo;t matter much at all. It only matters that it plays like Tetris.Teris is as good a game as Auto Racing.You can spectate a game of Tetris exactly once, and understand how the game is played. You can play Tetris exactly once and start to develop strategies to improve your next game. You can continue to improve at it, but Tetris can&rsquo;t be beaten. It is a game that test your skill, no matter what level that skill happens to be.Tetris is as good a game as Golf.No matter what device you are currently reading this on, you could also use that device to play Tetris. That version of Tetris will play pretty well. There are definitely controls that people prefer, like joysticks or gamepads or different configurations and sizes of buttons, but even most touch screen versions of Tetris play just fine. It&rsquo;s so good what you play it on almost doesn&rsquo;t matter. Tetris is as good a game as Trivial Pursuit. There are a lot of different variations on the original game and you can choose to play most of them against the game or against another person. They are all slightly different experiences, but they share the same simple mechanics. No matter how you play it, no matter what version you play, Tetris is all about preparation. You have to prepare for the moment that the one piece you need is drawn randomly from the small group of available pieces. It&rsquo;s about using what you know of the system to plan ahead, but being ready to improvise when you need to. Tetris is as good a game as Chess.Tetris is as good a game as Soccer.Tetris is as good a game as the 100 meter dash.Tetris will outlive its creator. Tetris will outlive its creators generation. And the next generation. And the next. Tetris will outlive the memory of its creation. Tetris is one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWe picked up one of the Microsoft Mixed Reality headsets more than a year ago. We have played a lot of games, and I have hooked up up to Unity to test out some of the development tools for VR, but It always felt a little wonky. There are a lot of claims that the inside out tracking on the headset might not be up to snuff, but I can safely say that the headset was never the problem. The headset has two wide angle cameras that look out at the world in front of them. By testing for changes in the position of static objects around it and comparing that information to internal gyroscope and accelerometer data, the headset can figure out where it is, if it moved, and where it moved too. It does this at a rate that is much faster than you could physically move your head, and because of this, the virtual world displayed in the headset stays pretty rock solid. If you think that can&rsquo;t possibly be accurate enough you&rsquo;re going to be blown away by how optical mice have been working for the last 30 years.Having tested the other two major VR headsets several times, I can safely say that, for regular use, the inside out tracking solution works just as well as the other positioning systems.My problem wasn&rsquo;t with the tracking, it was with the controllers. The same system that tracks where the headset is in space, keeps track of the two controllers, but rather than being wired to the computer they connect over bluetooth. They aren&rsquo;t the most comfortable of all of the current batch of VR controllers, but they aren&rsquo;t the worst either. For several months though, they were super flakey.Early on, the controllers would regularly freak out and stop registering, often when you were moving them quickly or turning around. Most games became a test of patience as you would watch one controller that had been behaving well start to twitch and move to positions that it would be impossible to get your actual hands into. In the Unity editor where things don&rsquo;t always react as quickly as you would like anyway, the controllers could become downright useless. I would wait with my hand hovering over an interaction point that I had set up until the controller decided to show up and snap to that same spot.It&rsquo;s worth noting, that while this was happening the headset continued to work properly. It even kept up when I would do things in the Unity editor with lights and physics that would slow down my framerate and cause pauses in the simulation. Through all that the headset continued to track properly and even respond to quick movements.One day I was connecting and disconnecting USB cables, as you do, and I thought to swap the XBOX controller receiver with the bluetooth adapter. The XBOX receiver had been finicky from day one and it only seemed to work properly when I plugged it into a USB extender so that it could get some distance from the PC case. I supposed that the case, or something in the case, had caused some interference with the wireless signal between the receiver and the controller so giving it that foot or so of separation from the PC had solved the issue. Instantly the problems I had with XBOX controllers went away and I could reliably use the controllers up to a room away even with a wall in between.I&rsquo;m not sure why it hadn&rsquo;t occurred to me for months, but it seems the same issue was plaguing the bluetooth adapter. I put the adapter on the short USB cable so that it sat a small gap from the PC case and that changed everything. Now the controllers follow your hands solidly and consistently. They react accurately to fast movements, like throwing or catching or punching. When the controllers move outside the view of your headset, like when you are reaching behind you or far out to the side, the accelerometers and gyroscopes take over and usually do a pretty good job. As soon as the cameras pick up the controllers, if they had strayed at all they instantly snap to their real locations.We have tested (played) a lot of our favorite VR experiences again and they have a whole new life. When you can count on the controls, games are so much more enjoyable and engaging. I suppose that isn&rsquo;t really a revelation. I have yet to test out the more demanding interactions in the Unity editor again, but I&rsquo;m pretty confident they would work much better now. I suppose the moral of this story is, when you are trouble shooting some problem, it&rsquo;s often easiest to blame the newest factor, or the most exotic component of a system. If there is a part that you don&rsquo;t really understand, like the camera based inside out tracking of this VR headset, it becomes very easy to lay the blame there and move on. In this case the problem was simple radio interference, something that should be familiar to anyone living on earth since the early 20th century, and usually solved by moving one of the antennas. Bad TV signal? Put the antenna on your roof. Lost GPS connection? Get out of the parking garage that&rsquo;s between you and the sky. VR controllers aren&rsquo;t working right? Move the bluetooth antenna a foot to the right. Cool. I&rsquo;m gonna have to set VRTK back up and test it out in Unity again.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tA small bit of movement on the story over here.&nbsp; As soon as I have one of my characters talk to another one of my characters, I first have to go and make sure that I know who they are, and that requires writing some other background and even a couple of test conversations. It's a slow constructions process, but hopefully it will be worth it in the end. I'm resisting the urge to go back in and rewrite stuff at the start that I find clunky, because I at least want to write up until the first major plot point before I start reworking earlier stuff. I have a couple of scenes later on already written, it's just a matter of filling in the space between here and there. I think this is why most writers don't put stuff out until they have at least one full draft. Too bad I guess. If you read it now you have to suffer the halting sentences and jarring pace.&nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - River RaidThe first thing you notice about River Raid is how beautiful it looks. Symmetric fields of solid color in perfectly balanced palettes. Everything on screen is clear and crisp. The second thing you notice is how smooth everything moves. The Atari 2600 is well known for its low resolution and chunky movement, but River Raid feels fluidly analog at all times. Next you notice the sound. In a world of digital farts and squawks somehow only the most harmonious tones were selected from the white noise generator built into the Atari 2600. River Raid sounds intense, but never jarring. When you start to play the game, the ramp from simple shooting gallery to incredibly demanding is so smooth you won&rsquo;t notice that the game is getting harder until you crash 3 times in span of a few seconds. Instantly you restart and try again, becoming incrementally better at the game with each attempt.There is no end to River Raid. No point where the game informs you of your mastery. It grows more difficult until it over taxes either your skills or your stamina. You can&rsquo;t beat it, you can only improve. It would be easy to suggest that this purity of design and presentation sprung from the limitations of the Atari 2600. Somehow I doubt that. Carol Shaw surpassed most of the perceived limitations of that simple computer in River Raid. She created a smooth, vibrant, aesthetically pleasing game on a system not really known for that sort of thing. The game explains itself while you play with no need for instructions or tutorials. It is abstract while being easily readable. River Raid could only exist as an interactive computer program. The engineering and the art only work when meshed together as one. It is a self contained wonderful thing polished to a high shine. River Raid isn&rsquo;t a product of limitations. River Raid is proof that we never really saw what the Atari 2600 was capable of, or more to the point, what a brilliant creator could accomplish with those simple tools. River Raid by Carol Shaw is one of the Best Games&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThere is no way that I will ever play all of these games. It will never happen. There was a brief window in the 80&rsquo;s and maybe the early 90&rsquo;s that a &lsquo;gamer&rsquo; could have at least touched most of the popular titles and genres. I have played a Megaman, and I have played a Romance of the Three Kingdoms. I have played Street Fighter, and Doom, and Space Quest. Action, strategy, sports, adventure, role playing, puzzle, narrative, abstract, simulation, educational. All the types, styles, and genres available, I played. There were games that I liked better than others, and game types that had their devoted fans, but there weren&rsquo;t subcultures. There was no punk rock or Jazz. No surrealist theater or period piece costume dramas. Gamers played games, and most likely they played all of them.I&rsquo;m not a psychologist or cultural anthropologist, but I think that this unifying of all people who play video games as &lsquo;gamers&rsquo; has caused us no small amount of problems. Ownership is a strong feeling. When people feel a sense of ownership over something they work on or create it can be very positive. We work harder and strive further when we feel like the thing we are working on represents some aspect of ourselves. Pride and accomplishment tied to our own sense of wellbeing and self worth can be beneficial or detrimental, but there is no denying it is powerful. So what happens when you tie that feeling of ownership and sense of self worth to something that is out of your direct control? Something you are a fan of.The actors and creative team of the most recent Star Wars movies probably have a few things to say about it. People who have attached part of their identity to their love of this sweeping space fantasy story can either be the warmest, most generous friend you haven&rsquo;t met, or the most bitter, jilted stalker you didn&rsquo;t know existed. It probably wouldn&rsquo;t be very long before you would feel very guarded against one, the other, or both. It isn&rsquo;t because these fans love Star Wars, it&rsquo;s because they feel they own Star Wars. They have dedicated themselves to minding the gate of what is and is not Star Wars to protect that part of themselves they have attached to it.This either sucks or is wonderful for the people involved in creating Star Wars, but that intense fandom doesn&rsquo;t wash over into other movies. The same people angry at, or praising Star Wars don&rsquo;t redirect their focus at Remains of the Day. There are no Kazuo Ishiguro fans screaming boycott when Never Let Me Go abandoned historical fiction to slum it in Sci-fi. The punk rockers don&rsquo;t storm in and kick over the symphony orchestra brass section because they are a tool of The Man. Movies, books, music, television, are all too broad and deep to see fans of one thing to drift over to attack creators and fans in another. Gaming hasn&rsquo;t been like that at all. For at least the first few decades, people who played video games were &lsquo;gamers&rsquo; and that sense of identification and ownership spanned an entire art form. The results are pretty tragic. The game industry is often singled out for its visible and invisible toxicity. Gamers attacking and harassing one another. Gamers attacking and harassing game creators. Gamers attacking women and marginalized groups for specific and sustained harassment. Gamers quite probably fostering the rise of alt right and exclusionist, isolationist sentiment. &lsquo;Gamers&rsquo; on balance, have been pretty fucking hideous.There is no way that I will ever play all of these games. It will never happen. It&rsquo;s not only me. There is no way that any person will ever play all of these games. There is no way that any person, no matter how dedicated to the artform of video games will ever even know about all of the games available. You can like and play video games, but there are subgenres, and subcultures, that you will never know about or engage with. People who feel othered can and will find groups that gather around the same types of games. People who have no interest in industry dramas will make friends and have fun in games you or I will never play. People with no interest in new trends or genre fads will play popular games, because their friends suggested them. People will play games in the way that they watch movies and read books. They will like what they like, sometimes well and sometimes poorly, but they won&rsquo;t stray far from those types of games. They will find what they enjoy and uncover new games as the feeling strikes them. The artform has grown too broad for people who enjoy it to be called &lsquo;Gamers&rsquo;. Losing that title is one step toward disentangling this wonderful artform from the sense of ownership that eats at everything we loved about it in the first place.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\t       You know how they say &ldquo;for every movie made there are 100 scripts on the shelf&rdquo;? Games are the same. I took one of my game ideas off the shelf recently. It had started as a video game riff on everyone's least favorite game mechanic, inventory management, but I have made some significant changes. Most notably, I&rsquo;ve changed it into a board game. The original intent for this game was for it to be a mobile or tablet, single player game that demanded fast reactions and decisions. Of course that sort of thing is not the strength of board games. Board games are slower, more contemplative, and usually turn based. The best board games are very communication focused. Creating an excuse for people to talk around a table is where board games shine.With that in mind, I had one of those shower thought moments where it occurred to me that Adventure Caddie could become a cooperative multiplayer game. Then I figured out how it would work turn based. After that it became a matter of putting it together to test it.I made some simple board and piece graphics in a vector program, printed them out, and glued them down to some cereal boxes. It&rsquo;s a really quick way to make usable board game prototypes and I highly recommend it. Then I started playing parts of it to see what worked and what didn&rsquo;t.I was lucky that I had written quite a lot of documentation about the rules and mechanics of the video game version, so a lot of the toughest problems had already been solved. I had spreadsheets with different in game items, characters, and enemies already filled out. I started going through all of it and tuning everything to the slower board game pace.Currently I have it working, but the numbers are all way off. The game isn&rsquo;t balanced. It is far too easy to get caught in a loop of failure or success. It plays, but I don&rsquo;t think that people would want to keep playing once they sense the ultimate outcome of all of their item moving and die rolling might have come down to one move early in the game. Like I said, it&rsquo;s not balanced.I have been going through my spreadsheets and tuning up the numbers and then copying them on to little cardboard squares. I hope to have it ready for some larger scale playtests soon to work out even more of the kinks. After that&hellip; who knows. Maybe I make it a print and play on my site, try to sell a few copies, or both. No matter what happens, it feels good to get one idea off the shelf and made real. Dozens more to go.&#8203;\t\t"

I tacked that on, but I haven't quite caught up with the other stuff I had been writing so that I could figure out how to write this stuff. It's a wacky non-linear world of writing. The real kicker is, I absolutely know for a fact that I will end up completely rewriting pretty much everything in the first chapter or so to make it flow better with everything else. I think I have made peace with that.&nbsp;Next week I think I'll write about working on a board game. Won't that be fun.&nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Commander KeenIf you played games on a pc in the early 90s you had to be happy with slower experiences. Adventure games, puzzle games, strategy games and microsoft flight simulator. To be fair one of those is a pretty intense piece of software, but accurate flight sims aren&rsquo;t the sort of thing that sells hardware to a lot of people. Not the sort of thing you can build a healthy market on. When you looked at the kind of games coming out on the Genesis and the SNES, the pc just wasn&rsquo;t that thrilling. There were a lot of reasons to buy PCs, they just didn&rsquo;t have much to do with games. Computers like the Amiga or the Commodore had a more or less unified set of hardware inside. If you were writing a game you could be sure that anyone that bought it would be able to run it on those machines. PCs came in a lot of flavours and some of them were barely able to manage a complicated spreadsheet. There were a few popular versions of DOS and the fledgling versions of windows would shake themselves apart as soon as any demands were put on them. If you wanted to play games there were a lot of options available, but you might skip the PC for any console. Since the mid to late 90s, the best place to play the most demanding and cutting edge games was, and remains, the PC. Consoles, tablets, phones, have all improved to the point that there is a truly startling amount of computer power in your pocket or in your hand right now, but none of them can keep pace with even a moderately powerful PC. For every major change, there has to be a turning point. In the case of the PC dominated video game industry that turning point is one game. Doom. Wait, no, not Doom. March back a few years and the same bunch of guys that eventually make Doom create a smooth, fast scrolling platformer that feels like a Mario game, but plays on a PC. Not a specially outfitted, super high end PC. Just a regular run of the mill PC that lots of folks had at their home or office used to run Word or Excel. Commander Keen was the proof that these computers could be used to make games that were at least as good as their console counterparts. And the first set of levels was free. If you had a PC you could pick up a disc or get a copy from a friend and play Commander Keen.So, was Commander Keen better than Mario? No. No it wasn&rsquo;t. But it was good, played well, and it had a quirky attractive charm to it that felt honest and genuine, not just a blatant ripoff. But mostly it changed the way people looked at their PCs. If you were interested in games you wouldn&rsquo;t instantly run to the current consoles or older Amiga games. You might give that shareware PC game a try. Commander Keen paved the way for 3D cards, Sound Cards, and PC gamepads. Without Commander Keen, I don&rsquo;t know that the PC as a gaming platform is guaranteed. Commander Keen, still one of the best PC games.&#8203;\t\t"

It took a lot of writing things that happen later on to figure out what should happen here at the start, so when I finally put all of the rest of it back in it will be a large dump of text all at once. As it is, it is still very much a draft and not a cleaned up and edited story, so if you go over there to read it you know what sort of thing you'll be getting. Turns out writing is hard, and writing something that works and stays consistent over at least dozens of pages takes some work and time. I've sort of broken up the story into what would best be described as episodes, so a single finished episode shouldn't be too long in coming, but the whole thing might take a while. I've also done a little looking into what it takes to put a short or long story together into something you can sell on a store like Amazon. I think I will always keep a version of it up here for free, but making it available to buy and download to a reader device of some sort seems like a pretty cool thing that I would like to do. So for the 20 or 30 people who regularly read this (I think the analytics lies when it says anything more than that), you can say you read it first back when it was all broken grammar and spelling errors.&nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWe watched a movie the other day that wasn&rsquo;t very good. Like I have said here many times, movies, comics, games, or other works of art that aren&rsquo;t particularly good don&rsquo;t bother me that much. It&rsquo;s not the worst crime in the world to create something that isn&rsquo;t very good. Personally, I happen to enjoy a lot of stuff that sits right on the axis of mediocre and weird. I have actively sought out poorly produced, cheaply made things that match my particular interests. There is an honesty to presenting something and saying &ldquo;well this is the best we could do with what we had. I hope you like it&rdquo; . Those are the sorts of things that look they they were probably fun to make. That said, I still can&rsquo;t help but analyze narrative works that fall short. Were there one or two scenes or moments that could have made me care about what is going on here. Was there a particular twist that wasn&rsquo;t adequate sold to the audience before it happens. In short, if a creator wants me to care about what is happening in the story, did they earn it. Watching a movie or reading a book that doesn&rsquo;t hit always makes me think about my writing or my own art. Mostly I think, that feeling I&rsquo;m trying to evoke, or that reaction I&rsquo;m trying to elicit, did I earn that. Even if the feeling I&rsquo;m going for is &ldquo;this is the best I could do&rdquo;, is it earned.That is what is going through my head most of the time while I move this story from outline/draft stage to draft/edit stage. Unfortunately I usually end up realizing, no, no it doesn&rsquo;t earn what I&rsquo;m going for. The only way to fix that is to type some more, fill in the blanks. Develop the characters and the setting. You know - write.Pretty soon I will have to take a bunch of this collected work and post it up, you know when it&rsquo;s not a swiss cheese collection of disconnected scenes. Also I will have to specifically inflict it on other people for feedback so that I can ask them if the setups read as genuine and the payoffs are earned. &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI&rsquo;ve been writing a lot of outline stuff and scattered scenes. This means that I haven&rsquo;t updated the main story I have been working on for a bit (over here), but it also means that there is a lot still happening on it. Of course, if I posted up the outline that would just give away the whole story, and that doesn&rsquo;t sound very fun. If I posted up some of the later scenes they might give away the story too, or at the very least not make much sense out of context with any surrounding scenes. Also not very fun. I&rsquo;m sure this won&rsquo;t come as news to any writers of long form narratives, but quite often I&rsquo;m finding that I need to write a few lines of a later scene to even have any idea how to write an earlier one.I will have a new revision of a few of the earlier scenes coming soon. Probably later this week. I&rsquo;ll post an update when that happens so that you can either choose to read it or not depending on how much you are interested in reading something under heavy construction.

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - GuwangeOkay. First off, there is absolutely no way that I can talk about a game that is part of a splinter off a sub-genre of a genre without wading deep into the weeds. I&rsquo;m going to toss out some titles and terms without defining them. If you read this hoping to find out what a shmup or STG is, you are in the wrong place. Also shmup is a stupid word and I won&rsquo;t have it placed idly in my writing without mocking it. You have been warned.If we were to draw a timeline of the vertically scrolling shooter game you would have to reach all the way back to Space Invaders. While not technically a scrolling shooter, due to the lack of scrolling, the core of the experience is there in Space Invaders. Moving and shooting while bullets rain down. You would step forward down that timeline to Galaga and Galaxian, still proto-scrolling shooters. Any sense of vertical movement in those games is superficial. Soon you would reach Xevious and 1942, both 100% vertically scrolling shooters. Maybe not the first, but very early versions of the form. You would snake your way through games like Tokio Scramble Formation and Varth, Turbo Force and Tiger Heli. The Sonic Wings series and Raiden series. All fine examples of a developing genre.There are several branch points where the vertical scrolling shooter split into distinct flavours. The standard vertical shooter, the vertical run and gun shooter, and the bullet hell shooter are some enduring favorites. Some would say that it was Cave Interactive&rsquo;s DonPachi or follow up DoDonPachi that solidified the branch of bullet hell or bullet curtain shooters, but they created a far more important game a few years later. Guwange was never as popular as many of the other shooters of it&rsquo;s time since it didn&rsquo;t see a wide release outside of Japan. Even so, there are a few things that Guwange did that make a game like Ikaruga possible.Before Guwange, the gimmick of throwing an unreasonable barrage of bullets at the player was what defined a bullet hell game. Guwange is less about challenging your dexterity and more about changing how you focus. Broadening your perception and forcing yourself into a flow state is the only real way to play Guwange.The beautiful, muted backdrop of a feudal Japan beset by demonic spirits provides the conceit for the game&rsquo;s core mechanic. Each of the three player characters can summon a spirit that the player can control to float around the screen attacking enemies. When you tap on the fire button you shoot normally, but when you hold down the fire button the spirit is released and the original character is constrained to slow left and right movement only. The spirit moves very quickly and is immune to bullets. The end result of these two different modes is that the player must pay attention to two different areas of the screen simultaneously. The vulnerable and slow moving main character, and the damage dealing and fast moving spirit. Oh, and one last thing, the spirit can slow enemy bullets to create some breathing room for the main character so you can&rsquo;t pay attention to only one of them. You will need to play both characters, simultaneously, to succeed.Written down, that sounds like an impossible task. Playing two characters at once on a screen otherwise filled with enemy bullets. Not only can you do it, you quickly find yourself playing through sections of Guwange intuitively. Never really focusing on any single spot on the screen. This is the sort of revelation that makes a developer believe that something like Ikaruga is not only possible, but playable by actual humans with regular human eyes and brains. Guwange is the turning point from one type of somewhat shallow gameplay, to a whole other world of depth and intriguing mechanics.Guwange is one of the best games, and if you can find it, you should play it.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI&rsquo;ve written a new post every week for 282 weeks, well 283 weeks now. Most of them hover just under 1000 words or so. There are a couple of haikus in there. Over the past year I added 6 short stories. Almost all of them were typed into either Libre Office or Google docs. That has been good enough until now. I am currently writing another story that is on the longer side. Google docs isn&rsquo;t really cutting it.I suppose it shouldn&rsquo;t come as much of a surprise. When I work on animation or 3D modelling I have a vast array of tools available to help organise and break down the task into manageable chunks. I have windows for animation clips, timing, layers, hierarchy. Game development and programming work is completed with the help of tools that offer visual outlines of the entire project tucked off to the side of the screen. These organization tools aren&rsquo;t a requirement. There are a lot of people who swear by typing code into a text editor with none of the support tools like autocomplete or project overview. That person isn&rsquo;t me. I appreciate the help. When it comes to writing I&rsquo;ve been mostly working without helper tools. If I wanted to remember something that I wrote earlier, I would go back and read it again. Pretty easy to do when the post is only 1000 words. Seriously though, keeping track of more than four or five characters is like a herculean trial for my brain. My soft squishy brain. I wanted the tools. I needed the tools.Lucky for me I found a program called yWriter. http://www.spacejock.com/yWriter6.html . It lets you take a writing task and break it down into bite sized pieces. You can see a visual layout of chapters and scenes, characters and locations. All the nuts and bolts of building a story are there. Plain and clear. Will yWriter make me better at writing. No, of course not. Stored palettes and layer blending modes don&rsquo;t make me better at painting either, but I would never want to give them up. yWriter makes the mechanics of putting together a larger story easier to grapple with. It&rsquo;s a toolbox. I have spent a 283 weeks of writing with fewer tools than I probably could have used. It&rsquo;s sort of nice to give these new tools a test drive. &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - WipeoutThe swirly, nature inspired, art nouveau in the early 1900s gave way to the more architectural and defined art deco of the 1920s and 30s. The psychedelic designs of the 60s and 70s provided a framework for the more angular, dimensional design of the 80s and 90s. &nbsp;The design of Wipeout fed directly off of the increasingly digital, splashy, design in the early 90s but leapfrogged into the future. The graphic design of this hovercraft racing game from 1995, when most games were still trying to evoke some aspect of grunge rock or gangsta rap culture, laid out a visual language roadmap for the next 20 years.Shapes composed of parallel lines and strokes of a consistent thickness. Solid, vibrant color and smoothly radiused corners. This is the design language of modern technology. This is the language that defines the icons and controls on the computer, phone, or tablet you are reading this on right now. This was the same language used to represent fictional racing teams Feisar and Qirex and Auricom in 1995. Prescient, influential, or both Wipeout is pure, distilled graphic design from top to bottom. It helps that Wipeout is a fantastic racing game. It combines the slippery speed of rocket powered hover ships with an on-track combat mechanic similar to Mario Kart. The game plays great and feels faster and more demanding than most other games of it&rsquo;s era. That isn&rsquo;t why Wipeout is important. That isn&rsquo;t why it still resonates. It&rsquo;s the visual design that endures.Wipeout was made to feel, sound, and look like the future. That future, at least visually, became our present. Even if you have never played Wipeout you can see it&rsquo;s influence all around you. Now, knowing that, it makes you wonder what aesthetic being developed right now for some piece of pop culture will send its waves out into the future.Wipeout is graphic design condensed into video game form, and it is one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWe have a concept around these parts called &lsquo;good stupid&rsquo;. More to the point, stupid exists on a gradient between &lsquo;bad stupid&rsquo; and &lsquo;good stupid&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m not referring to people here. I&rsquo;m not using stupid as an insult. Good and bad stupid are almost exclusively used to describe movies or games or music. Entertainment. As an example, Pacific Rim is good stupid. Bright is bad stupid. The difference between these two movies is how aware they are that their basic premise is nonsense. While the characters in Pacific Rim don&rsquo;t appear to be aware that everything happening around them is silly, the movie constantly winks and nods at the audience. The creators are aware of how stupid it is and they lean into that stupid in fun ways. Bright presents itself as a veiled social commentary but can&rsquo;t help stepping on itself in the process. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to know how stupid it is. There is a gag in Bright where the human character played by Will Smith calls an Orc character &lsquo;Shrek lookin&rsquo;. This is a world where Orcs exists and, seemingly, have existed for thousands of years. Shrek is a CG animated movie about an Ogre. CG animated would mean that Shrek had to be a movie made in the very recent past in that world. Not only is it horrific to consider that people made a movie like Shrek in that world, having a main character use it as a joke is almost inexcusable. As an audience we are given a lot to consider in that moment. It&rsquo;s not really a joke, but one of the main characters, a man who is supposed to be on a redemptive arc, being hateful and cruel. As soon as you think about it, the movie and the character never recover. The internal logic of the &lsquo;stupid&rsquo; movie crumbles and the only conclusion you can come to is that the creators really didn&rsquo;t know what it was they were making. Bad stupid. That is a particularly blatant example of bad stupid. For bad stupid of the more careless rather than thoughtless variety you can always look to the Transformers movies. The Transformers as a concept is pretty stupid, giant robots that hide as vehicles and structures even though the people of earth they are hiding from pose absolutely zero threat to them. Or maybe they are hiding from each other, except they why bother changing shape when they could easily hide underground or in the ocean. The cartoons and comics understood how stupid it was and offered this option: giant robots are cool, cars and jets are cool. Want to see a robot that turns into a car or a jet? Yeah? Want to see them fight? Okay. And now everything else that these giant robots do from here on out will absolutely not point out how ridiculous this concept is. That&rsquo;s what we would call &lsquo;good stupid&rsquo;.The Transformers movies forget all of that, sideline the Transformers as secondary characters and comic relief in a movie named after them and consist of action set pieces that don&rsquo;t link in any logical way. Bad Stupid. Due to the limitations of the medium, up until a few years ago video games have almost all existed in the realm of &lsquo;good stupid&rsquo;. Why is Mario running from left to right. Doesn&rsquo;t matter. No effort is ever made to explain or expand on that. If anything, the narrative drive of attempting to rescue a princess weakens the game. Running and jumping is why you play that game. You could just as easily have made the end goal of each level collecting all of the ingredients for a really good salad. That&rsquo;s the kind of silly I can really go for. For the most part, it&rsquo;s &lsquo;good stupid&rsquo;. &lsquo;Good Stupid&rsquo; in games isn&rsquo;t anti-narrative though. A game like Dream Daddy where you play as a dad dating other dads presents a weird idealised world of pleasant characters and uncomplicated sexuality. The world is absurd, but through that lens the creators tell stories about unconditional love within families and interactions between people just searching for companionship and sharing joy in their lives. The premise is silly, but very much &lsquo;good stupid&rsquo;With the technology of games improving, there will always be this drive to strive for realism or grit or accuracy. The systems and method of interaction with video games is still pretty ridiculous. &nbsp;Pressing buttons on a controller is not like jumping and selecting items from a menu is nothing like actually talking to a person. Until we come up with something better video games will remain pretty silly. I say lean into it. Better to be &lsquo;good stupid&rsquo; than &lsquo;bad stupid&rsquo;.&#8203;\t\t"

I realize that can be a bit annoying if anyone was trying to find a particular post. You can search for strings in the search bar that sits just up and to the right on the desktop version of the site. The string &ldquo;Best Games&rdquo; will, for example, return every post in the &ldquo;Best Games&rdquo; series where I examine why a specific game is good or important. I posted most of the stories in parts. I would work on them, post what was done, edit, append, and repost them over and over until they were complete. Searching for those might be a little tricky. Since I now have 6 short stories and 2 more in the works, I thought I should organize a bit. The menu now includes a new dropdown that has all the completed stories and the unfinished one that is the furthest along. You are welcome to read any of them, but the unfinished ones will be in a constant state of chaos and awful sentence structure. So, you know, fair warning. I won&rsquo;t post the stories here anymore, but I will post links and updates as they progress and take shape.I will still be writing a new post for the front of the blog every monday, but some of them might just be a link to updates and progress over on one of the story pages.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tSo I wrote a few more pages in the longer story I have been working on thinking that this new stuff would directly follow the stuff that I have already posted. Of course it&rsquo;s not nearly that simple. I immediately discovered that this new stuff needs something, probably only a couple more pages, to bridge to the previous stuff. Right now it&rsquo;s all just a bunch of disconnected stuff. When I was writing the super short 1-5 page stories I could do that pretty easily. I could write a line or a scene that comes in the middle or near the end of the story and then fill in the gaps. I quickly found that I usually didn&rsquo;t know what those gaps had to be until I had defined their shape with scenes before and after, or even off to the side of them. It&rsquo;s probably unsurprising that I tend to think of stories as collections of scenes, since pretty much all of my storytelling experience comes from visual media - stage, film, etc. Because of that I also tend to think about all of it in terms of editing, the film kind not the literary kind. The stories I put together in my head are shot out of order and reassembled in post. There are probably better ways to write stories, but those are all the tools I have in my box, and until I gather some new ones I think these are the tools I will have to make use of. I could post up a bunch of disconnected scenes, but I don&rsquo;t think that would be very entertaining to read. Also, some of the unassembled islands of &lsquo;stuff&rsquo; are from very late in the story and that would be pretty spoilery. For me at least, writing non-linearly works well. Reading non-linearly remains a poor experience. Here is what I think I will do. Every once in a while I will drop very large chunks of story on a separate page that I will link from one of these posts. That way the story can live on its own over there as an incomplete, but readable, piece that you can check in on from time to time. If that is something you are interested in.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tAKA Changelog 0003I realized the other day that I hadn&rsquo;t written a changelog in quite a while, like since last september. Until quite recently I have been working on other contracts and projects so not much headway was being made on my own game. I went back to see what I had written then. Unsurprisingly, not much has changed. No game dev elves picked through my files to fix anything or finish up my work. This post could be considered getting back into the swing of it again. I wrote back then that I was working on the enemy pathfinding and AI. I&rsquo;m right back at that, but I have given the Navmesh part of the pathfinding less and less priority in favor of independent enemy ai using sensors and a general awareness of the world. This seems to pair better with physics interactions and physics based movement. One major thing I have changed is that I started using the dungeon architect add on for unity to help create level layouts. It has been very helpful for testing, since I can now change levels and level elements with a couple clicks or a simple script. Anyone reading this who is familiar with game development, and especially game development in unity, will be nodding along. Everyone else, sorry you suffered through that. Next week will probably be more story. &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - GauntletArcade games from the early 80&rsquo;s are either so simple that the rules of play are apparent just by looking at the screen, or they are so abstract that it&rsquo;s a puzzle just to decipher the controls. Gauntlet is a little of column A and a little of column B.If you were handed a screenshot of Gauntlet you would have no trouble figuring out the moment to moment gameplay. You guide one of 4 fantasy trope characters through a maze of monsters and treasure. It seems pretty straight forward. If you play it, you would quickly find that it&rsquo;s not so simple.Like Dungeons &amp; Dragons that influences it there are a lot of systems at play in Gauntlet. Your health is constantly decreasing but there is food available to boost you back up. Some enemies must be shot with your ranged weapon and some can be crashed into to defeat them hand to hand. Magic potions are room clearing super weapons but you might want to save them up to deal with the grim reaper. Combine these systems with the blistering pace of action and it would be very easy to miss most of them. It&rsquo;s a game that you could very easily spend many quarters on and never understand what the traps do, or why that food just disappeared. Gauntlet might be one of the first games to include an in game tutorial system in the form of the ever present announcer. Very few games before Gauntlet included digitized speech. It was just too expensive and there wasn&rsquo;t a compelling reason outside of novelty to add it. In Gauntlet it makes sense to quickly pause the action and deliver some information. When you hear that &ldquo;Elf needs food&hellip; badly!&rdquo; you won&rsquo;t forget or ignore it. When the music chimes in followed by the instruction &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot food&rdquo; you will pay a little more attention to your aim. When you hear &ldquo;Valkyrie is about to die&rdquo; you will know that it is less important to clear every monster from a level, and more important that you make it to the next exit.Gauntlet teaches you how to play it while you are playing. It nudges you to improve. Of course Gauntlet also originated and perfected the microtransaction with the ability to add more health just by paying a quarter for it. It was pay to win before that was ever a thing. But let&rsquo;s not let it&rsquo;s sins overshadow it&rsquo;s achievements. Gauntlet is a good game, but it teaches you how to enjoy it. That makes it one of the Best Games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tNo new story or chapter this time. I&rsquo;m still writing (and rewriting) the next part and I swear there is a plan. Well like 80% of a plan. The other 20% I&rsquo;ll figure out when I get to it. Or I won&rsquo;t. I suppose that is an option. Anyway, I wanted to write a bit about animation. Over the past few months I have gone from knowing very little about Unity&rsquo;s Mecanim animation controller / state machine to, well, still knowing very little but it&rsquo;s an actionable very little. It&rsquo;s the very little that I can use to get some work done. There is a simple beauty in the way that mecanim works. It&rsquo;s very much geared toward game development but I think that any animator would benefit from using something similar. I&rsquo;m not going to give a mecanim tutorial or anything here, because first I don&rsquo;t think I really know enough about the minutia to do that, and second that sounds like a boring read. Instead, here is why I think this is a useful tool for every animators toolbox.There are a lot of requirements for a piece of animation. If it&rsquo;s a character it needs to engage the audience with a sense of internal life and movement with intent. If it&rsquo;s &nbsp;mechanical animation it needs to be physically consistent and purposeful. If it&rsquo;s fx animation it needs to buoy and enhance the scene. Cool. Enough with the artsy nonsense. There are some other things that animation needs to do. It needs to fit a certain motion into a finite amount of time, often a very short amount of time. It needs to seamlessly link up with the animation that precedes and follows it. It needs to conform to screen space and composition requirements. You can animate the most beautiful flowing motions and the most emotionally impactful subtlety, but if it doesn&rsquo;t work with everything else being presented it is bad animation.Games are interactive so they are difficult or impossible to pace in the way that a film or tv show would be. The player doesn&rsquo;t have to follow the script and storyboards. If they want to jump or run in a circle while important dialog is being delivered, they can and often will. A game has to allow for that. Tools like mecanim exist to account for this chaotic element. Mecanim breaks motions and character interactions down into a series of states. You can set it up so that certain motions can blend into other motions. If, for example, the player presses the jump button. You can have the character transition into a jump animation that includes a crouch, extend, arc through the air, and land absorbing the impact. The character then returns to a ready position and the player can press the jump button again. Realistic maybe, but in an action game that wouldn&rsquo;t feel very responsive. What if the character took a shoulder tackle mid way through the jump. Do you wait for your beautiful jump animation to finish before transitioning into the beautiful tackle reaction animation. Or do you break that jump up into separate chunks that can &nbsp;be transitioned into and out of at any point. Now when the player character is extending their legs and just about to leave the ground, you can have the shoulder tackle interrupt that animation in a convincing way. Using mecanim means thinking about you animations differently, less like a scripted performance and more like a set of possible performances. There are already some animators groaning that this steals the dynamism and pacing from their control. Bunk. At the core of what an animator does is solving the problem of making a thing that has no life seem to be alive. The problem remains the same whether solving it for a scripted, linear scene or a possibility space of potential scenes. Making the character or environment live from moment to moment is still the job. What working with a tool like mecanim does to the way you think about animation forces you to consider the technical. Managing time and space becomes much more important. Creating animations that can cleanly link from one to another at pretty much any point becomes important. The constraints of the tool become strengths. A nice character moment can&rsquo;t exist in only one scene, but must be available any time the player triggers it. It makes you as an animator consider character intention even in otherwise static moments. When motions are chopped up into slices of a handful of frames each, every moment becomes a time that you can express the internal intentions of a character or piece of animation.Ryu&rsquo;s idle animation in SFII is 4 frames. 4 frames. Every ounce of internality, every bit of intention, everything that tells you who that character is lives in 4 frames of animation. Using mecanim will force you learn just a little of how that is possible. &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tOkay. That's chapter one. I think. It's a very early chapter at the very least. I won't post updates on this story every week, but I will post every new chapter. If you have any suggestions, questions, edits, or criticisms, please send them my way. I'm not done editing this by a long shot, and pretty much everything could change. It's all about the rewrites.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hold up. I see one. Due south.&rdquo;The flatbed came to a lurching stop and bounced slightly as the one back wheel settled to the ground.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo;Jan handed the binoculars down to Khary through the open cab window. He took off his glasses, folded them neatly and placed them in his shirt pocket before accepting the binoculars and pivoting them up to his eyes. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;&ldquo;Straight south.&rdquo; She pointed toward the find even though the roof of the cab made it impossible for Khary to see where her hand was directing him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s laying down in the grass.&rdquo;He twisted slightly to survey the field of waving brome. There it was. Just barely visible among the green and brown tufts. The mottled colors of the plate matched its surroundings almost perfectly, Almost. The grasses swayed and drifted, but the patterned armour remained as unmoving as a stone. Khary handed the binoculars back up through the window. &ldquo;Good eye. Tell me when you&rsquo;re holding on.&rdquo;Jan beamed with pride as she took back the binoculars and slung them over her neck. She grabbed hold of the welded steel frame that acted as a lookout perch behind the cab and hollered down &ldquo;Ready!&rdquo;Three of the float plates engaged with a dense hum, the fourth one wheezed slightly, before the flatbed jolted forward. The single metal wheel they had attached to compensate for an anemic float plate skipped along uneven ground pocked by gopher holes. The entire flatbed vibrated and Jan gripped a little tighter. As the vehicle accelerated from &lsquo;brisk walk&rsquo; to &lsquo;commendable jog&rsquo;, the wheel finally lifted off the ground. The vibrations stopped, and the flatbed gilded silently, save for the harmony of hum and wheeze beneath Jan&rsquo;s feet.Jan tried to keep her eyes on the fallen armour, but it was difficult to see over the cab. It wouldn&rsquo;t have moved. They never do when they hit the dirt like that. &ldquo;Depleted&rdquo; was the word Khary used. It was the word he had learned as an apprentice and the word she would be expected to pass down to her apprentice. Armours were &ldquo;Active&rdquo;, &ldquo;Inactive&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Depleted&rdquo;. Not &ldquo;Alive&rdquo;. Never &ldquo;Dead&rdquo;.Khary drifted the flatbed to a gentle stop a few meters away from the depleted Armour.&ldquo;Get the winch ready. Let&rsquo;s see what we got.&rdquo; Khary called up from the cab.Jan could see from here that this Armour was most likely Concordian, or a Uniune decoy made to appear Concordian. It was easily over a century old, judging by the wear at the joints. The protective plating abraded to a dull smooth finish. In the time she had been riding with Khary they had recovered 43 just like it. They had spotted another 56 active Concordian units and stayed well out of their range just be safe. Khary had called out most of them from the cab before Jan had seen them, despite her riding in the lookout perch and clinging tightly to the binoculars. He knew exactly what type of Armour they were looking at, but he always said &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s see what we got&rsquo;. Probably another phrase that he had inherited from his mentor and was now being passed down to her. She had already adopted so many of his verbal tics and mannerisms, but &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s see what we got.&rsquo; seemed like a quaint affection she could skip. Jan suppressed the urge to roll her eyes.Khary hopped down from the cab, and removed his ever present beige cap. The original olive green dye could still be seen at the seams, but the rest was beige. He ran his hand across patches of tight black curls, islands of hair in an ocean of deep brown scalp. Jan figured that Khary hoped to one day discover handfuls of thick wavy mane up there, but today wasn&rsquo;t the day. He would most likely search again in an hour or so. Until then, he slapped the cap back on and tugged it into place.Jan had unlocked the winch and replaced the standard clip with the older Concordian forked hook configuration. She jumped down from the side of the flatbed and joined Khary in quizzically assessing the depleted Armour. Khary shot Jan a sidelong glance. He was clearly considering something, but he hadn&rsquo;t let her in on what it was yet. He looked back at the Armour and pulled out his pocket radio. &ldquo;Really? I didn&rsquo;t notice any change in the field riding out.&rdquo; Jan Blurted.&rdquo;Still weak enough to pull in signals from Rose Lake. It was fiddle music all the way out here.&rdquo;Khary ignored her and slid his finger across the flat rectangle. Static, different static, and then a jaunty toe tapper. The sort of fiddle music that Jan liked well enough when she was drunk and dancing with northern townie boys. Listening to it for hours on the radio was a bit much though. Khary never seemed to tire of it.&ldquo;See. Depleted. There is no field here.&rdquo; Jan said flatly.Khary nodded slowly, not at all convinced. &ldquo;You go feet. I&rsquo;ll go head&rdquo;For all the confident &lsquo;depleted&rsquo; talk, Jan still took a wide, slow path to take up her position at the Armours feet. Khary went toward the head hauling the winch line with him.The Armour was face down in the dirt, arms and legs splayed but relaxed, like it had laid down to rest ages ago and just never got back up. That probably wasn't far from the truth. Armours were sturdy, but nothing is made to last forever. Other than being depleted, Jan could see nothing unusual about this Armour. About 3 meters tall, probably 250 kilograms clad head to toe in smooth chitinous plates of engineered fungus. Impacts, heat, cold, radiation, judging by the healed over scars this unit had experienced them all and shrugged them off. The one force it couldn&rsquo;t withstand was time. &ldquo;Keep clear of that weapon.&rdquo; Khary chided in that parental tone of his. He kept his voice low, but clear, like he was presiding over a funeral. Jan felt it was an unnecessary affectation. They could scream, or sing, or laugh. She was pretty sure the Armour wouldn&rsquo;t be offended.Jan looked over to where the Armours right forearm lay pointing back toward its feet. The launch tubes were empty and the rail was wide open. A tuft of grass was growing through the heat exchange vents. This Armour hadn&rsquo;t created any ammunition or fired that weapon in years.&ldquo;Uh yeah. I think it&rsquo;s good&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you talking or listening.&rdquo;Khary stared back at her. It was the &lsquo;take this serious&rsquo; look. Jan nodded and acquiesced but couldn&rsquo;t hold back a small grin.&ldquo;Weapon appears depleted. Staying off axis.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good. Okay. So, what have we got?&rdquo;Jan made a show of looking the Armour over. Tipping her head and squinting slightly. &ldquo;Concordian medium ranger. Fifth gen, maybe?&rdquo;Khary gathered the winch line into a loop in his free hand. &ldquo;Yep, but it&rsquo;s probably a fourth gen with a modification to the back plate for carrying equipment. We&rsquo;ll be able to tell for sure when we flip it over. The sternum is different on-&rdquo;Jan heard what sounded like firewood being split and almost at the same instant the weapon spinning down. Small flakes of shredded grass hung in the midday air. Khary still stood across from her looking like a question had just occurred to him and he desperately wanted to ask it. The Armour had both of its arms raised above its head, but nothing else seemed to have moved.Khary wobbled slightly and looked down. His right leg, from knee to foot, stood perfectly upright like a post driven into the earth. The rest of him did not.The next instant she was running. She didn&rsquo;t remember deciding to run, but she was already halfway up the Armours back, landing her left foot deftly along its spine plating. Her next step landed on the back of its neck and she felt her foot lose traction. The Armour remained as unperturbed as a stone. Dark fluid had arced up from somewhere splashing across the Armour&rsquo;s shoulder. Jan barely registered it as she crashed down, rolling over until her face was inches from Khary&rsquo;s.His lips were twisted up in a grimace, gathering the strength to scream or cry out in pain.Instead, he glared straight back at Jan and grunted out &ldquo;Stupid!. Damn Stupid!&rdquo;.Jan wrestled with her tongue trying to get any words out at all. Eventually she croaked out &ldquo;Are you-&rdquo;Khary cut her off. &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m not okay. Look at my damn leg! Hook the winch up! Put us both on the flatbed.&rdquo;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go back to town. We can be there before sundown.&rdquo; Jan blurted. &ldquo;The medic, or the monks can help.&rdquo;Khary grabbed her around the back of her neck and pulled her closer.&ldquo;No, Here&rsquo;s what your gonna do. Wrap that winch line around my leg. Hook it up to the armour and put us both on the flatbed. Then you take us to Eliza or Ahmed.&rdquo;&ldquo;But we can get to Ashbank. They have-&rdquo;&ldquo;Are you talking, or are you listening?&rdquo; The bite had left Khary&rsquo;s voice, and his breathing had grown shallow. He squinted into the bright sun and managed slight grin.Jan Looked down at Khary&rsquo;s leg. She had seen it already, but the image didn&rsquo;t register as real. Now she took it in.In less than an eyeblink the Armour had reached up and clamped one claw-like hand just above Khary&rsquo;s right ankle. His fibula and tibia had shattered to shards and grit instantly. His leg bent awkwardly below the knee. Bits of bone had torn through his coveralls and they were stained dark and wet.The Armours other arm had aimed and fired, but there was nothing left in it to launch, save dust and blades of unfortunate grass.Jan snatched up the winch line and looped it just above Khary&rsquo;s knee, leaving enough slack to hook the forks between the Armours shoulder blades. She looked over at Khary before bolting for the flatbed. He nodded grim approval of her work. She went for the switch that would reel them in.&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Khary raised his head up slightly and pulled his cap down snug. &ldquo;Just a second.&rdquo;He took a moment to take one deep breath and release it slowly. &ldquo;Okay. Okay. Do it.&rdquo;Jan winced as she pressed the switch as if the pain were her own. Khary didn&rsquo;t cry out. He didn&rsquo;t scream in agony or delirium. He chuckled. A light bouncing of the breath as if he had just thought of a subtle joke. The line pulled taught and Khary and the Armour both were dragged toward the flatbed. The vehicle bowed automatically to receive them forcing it&rsquo;s single metal wheel out to the side. The winch steadily reeled in the line and soon Khary slid up beside Jan. She stopped the motor for a moment to cradle Khary&rsquo;s head and shoulders lifting him up over the short lip of the flatbed. Tears were streaming down his dark weathered cheeks. He laughed between choked sobs.&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t even hurt Jan. I don&rsquo;t feel anything. I just noticed. I don&rsquo;t feel anything. Take me to the Armourer, okay? Take me to the Armourer, Jan. You listening?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;m listening.&rdquo; Jan was surprised by the tears running down her own cheeks. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;Jan played fiddle music on the radio all the way to Riverbend.&#8203;\t\t"

I see one. Due south.&rdquo;The flatbed came to a lurching stop and bounced slightly as the one back wheel settled back to the ground.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo;Jan handed the binoculars down to Khary through the open cab window. He took off his glasses, folded them neatly and placed them in his shirt pocket before accepting the binoculars and pivoting them up to his eyes. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;&ldquo;Straight south.&rdquo; She pointed toward the find even though the roof of the cab made it impossible for Khary to see where her hand was directing him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s laying down in the grass.&rdquo;He twisted slightly to glass the field of waving brome. There it was. Just barely visible among the green and brown tufts. The mottled colors of the plate matched its surroundings almost perfectly, but where the grasses swayed and drifted, the patterned armour remained as unmoving as a stone. Khary handed the binoculars back up through the window. &ldquo;Good eye. Tell me when you&rsquo;re holding on.&rdquo;Jan beamed with pride as she took back the binoculars and slung them over her neck. She grabbed hold of the welded steel frame that acted as a lookout perch behind the cab and hollered down &ldquo;Ready!&rdquo;Three of the float plates engaged with a dense hum, the fourth one wheezed slightly, before the flatbed jolted forward. The single metal wheel they had attached to compensate for an anemic float plate skipped along uneven ground pocked by gopher holes. The entire flatbed vibrated and Jan gripped a little tighter. As the vehicle accelerated from &lsquo;brisk walk&rsquo; to commendable jogging pace, the wheel finally lifted off the ground. The vibrations stopped, and the flatbed gilded silently, save for the harmony of hum and wheeze beneath Jan&rsquo;s feet.Jan tried to keep her eyes on the fallen armour, but it was difficult to see over the cab. It wouldn&rsquo;t have moved. They never do when they hit the dirt like that. &ldquo;Depleted&rdquo; was the word Khary used. It was the word he had learned as an apprentice and the word she would be expected to pass down to her apprentice. Armours were &ldquo;Active&rdquo;, &ldquo;Inactive&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Depleted&rdquo;. Not &ldquo;Alive&rdquo;. Never &ldquo;Dead&rdquo;.Khary drifted the flatbed to a gentle stop a few meters away from the depleted Armour.&ldquo;Get the winch ready. Let&rsquo;s see what we got.&rdquo; Khary called up from the cab.Jan could see from here that this Armour was most likely Concordian, or a Uniune decoy made to appear Concordian. It was easily over a century old, judging by the wear at the joints. In the time she had been riding with Khary they had recovered 43 just like it. They had spotted another 56 active Concordian units and stayed well out of their range just be safe. Khary had called out most of them from the cab before Jan had seen them, despite her riding in the lookout perch and clinging tightly to the binoculars. He knew exactly what type of Armour they were looking at, but he always said &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s see what we got&rsquo;. Probably another phrase that he had inherited from his mentor and was now being passed down to her. She had already adopted so many of his verbal tics and mannerisms, but &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s see what we got.&rsquo; seemed like a quaint affection she could skip. Jan suppressed the urge to roll her eyes.Khary hopped down from the cab, and removed his ever present beige cap. He ran his hand across patches of tight black curls, islands of hair in an ocean of deep brown scalp. Jan figured that Khary hoped to one day discover handfuls of thick wavy mane up there, but today wasn&rsquo;t the day. He would most likely search again in an hour or so. Until then, he slapped the cap back on and tugged it into place.Jan had unlocked the winch and replaced the standard clip with the older Concordian forked hook configuration. She jumped down from the side of the flatbed and joined Khary in quizzically assessing the depleted Armour. Khary shot Jan a sidelong glance. He was clearly considering something, but he hadn&rsquo;t let her in on what it was yet. He looked back at the Armour and pulled out his pocket radio. &ldquo;Really? I didn&rsquo;t notice any change in the field riding out.&rdquo; Jan Blurted.&rdquo;Still weak enough to pull in signals from Rose Lake. It was fiddle music all the way out here.&rdquo;Khary ignored her and slid his finger across the flat rectangle. Static, different static, and then a jaunty toe tapper. The sort of fiddle music that Jan liked well enough when she was drunk and dancing with northern townie boys. Listening to it for hours on the radio was a bit much though. Khary never seemed to tire of it.&ldquo;See. Depleted. There is no field here.&rdquo; Jan said flatly.Khary nodded slowly, not at all convinced. &ldquo;You go feet. I&rsquo;ll go head&rdquo;For all the confident &lsquo;depleted&rsquo; talk, Jan still took a wide, slow path to take up her position at the Armours feet. Khary went toward the head hauling the winch line with him.The Armour was face down in the dirt, arms and legs splayed but relaxed, like it had laid down to rest ages ago and just never got back up. That probably wasn't far from the truth. Armours were sturdy, but nothing is made to last forever. Other than being depleted, Jan could see nothing unusual about this Armour. About 3 meters tall, probably 250 kilograms clad head to toe in smooth chitinous plates of engineered fungus. Impacts, heat, cold, radiation, judging by the healed over scars this unit had experienced them all and shrugged them off. The one force it couldn&rsquo;t withstand was time. &ldquo;Keep clear of that weapon.&rdquo; Khary chided in that parental tone of his. He kept his voice low, but clear, like he was presiding over a funeral. Jan felt it was an unnecessary affectation. They could scream, or sing, or laugh. She was pretty sure the Armour wouldn&rsquo;t be offended.Jan looked over to where the Armours right forearm lay pointing back toward its feet. The launch tubes were empty and the rail was wide open. A tuft of grass was growing through the heat exchange vents. This Armour hadn&rsquo;t created any ammunition or fired that weapon in years.&ldquo;Uh yeah. I think it&rsquo;s good&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you talking or listening.&rdquo;Khary stared back at her. It was the &lsquo;take this serious&rsquo; look. Jan nodded and acquiesced but couldn&rsquo;t hold back a small grin.&ldquo;Weapon appears depleted. Staying off axis.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good. Okay. So, what have we got?&rdquo;Jan made a show of looking the Armour over. Tipping her head and squinting slightly. &ldquo;Concordian medium ranger. Fifth gen, maybe?&rdquo;Khary gathered the winch line into a loop in his free hand. &ldquo;Yep, but it&rsquo;s probably a fourth gen with a modification to the back plate for carrying equipment. We&rsquo;ll be able to tell for sure when we flip it over. The sternum is different on-&rdquo;Jan heard what sounded like firewood being split and almost at the same instant the weapon spinning down. Small flakes of shredded grass hung in the midday air. Khary still stood across from her looking like a question had just occurred to him and he desperately wanted to ask it. The Armour had both of its arms raised above its head, but nothing else seemed to have moved. That&rsquo;s when Khary tipped over sideways and howled.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tA few weeks ago I started on a story. I got a short way into what I thought was the introduction, when I realized that, not only would this story be larger than my previous ones, but that wasn't the introduction at all. That was second or third chapter material. I have also written some stuff that would have to happen much much later. This led to writing an outline and some other character stuff. And then I rewrote and revised that outline again and again. So what I'm saying is maybe this is the start, and this might be long. I'll just keep plugging away and see what it is when it's finished.&ldquo;Hold up. I see one. Due south.&rdquo;The flatbed came to a lurching stop and bounced slightly as the one back wheel settled back to the ground.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo;Jan handed the binoculars down to Khary through the open cab window.

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - AsteroidsVideo game creators have been ripping and rehashing ideas from other games since the start of the medium. If you combine the 2D physics sim of Space War with the overwhelming odds and impending doom of Space Invaders, you arrive at something like Asteroids. Even the accelerating heartbeat soundtrack and ufo klaxons echo the sound design of Space invaders. So many aspects of Asteroids are cribbed that it seems unlikely it would be noteworthy, but it&rsquo;s the way the the game refines and reframes those core concepts that sets it apart.In Asteroids you control one small spaceship, iconically represented by a sharply defined line art triangle positioned at center screen. The rest of the screen is a black void that eventually fills with equally iconic representations of jagged rocks.The playfield is like a continuous sphere unwrapped and laid flat. Objects travel around it, but never actually leave it, passing from one side of the screen to emerge again on the other. The infinite playfield concept is lifted almost entirely from SpaceWar. This was a smart move, because it means that any asteroid travelling off one side of the screen can easily be anticipated as it emerges from the other. The asteroids travel in hyper predictable straight lines. This creates the first part of my theory of fun. The human brain's ability to organize chaos is enjoyable. Identifying patterns of movement on a screen filled with icons of rocks all travelling at different speeds in different directions is fun. Using that information to shoot the asteroids breaking them into smaller parts that move in even more directions could have finished the design. That would have been enough to hold a lot of people's attention. It would have been fun, but not challenging, and most importantly for the early arcade business, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been difficult enough to &nbsp;make enough money fast enough. People are just too good at identifying and predicting patterns.At intervals a chaotic ufo will appear and fire at you forcing you to shift your attention. If you ignore it, it can and will destroy your ship. If you ignore the asteroids, they can and will overwhelm you, predictable or not. The second you get comfortable destroying the rocks, the ufo appears to draw your focus. When you manage to destroy the ufo, the pattern of rocks has changed so substantially that it has become an entirely new mental problem to deal with. That means the game has become harder, but also more fun. By mixing ideas from two very different games, the unpredictable actions of another human in SpaceWar, and the regimented predictability of the invaders from Space Invaders, Asteroids strikes an almost perfect balance of fun. Games created after this will include more random elements, and more shifts between chaotic and predictable action. Asteroids is not only one of the best games, it might be the first video game to zero in on what makes games fun. &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI would post some of the later stuff, but that would read very disjointed, since it would be excerpts and scenes from different places in the story that I haven't tied together yet. Instead, here is some more refinement on the intro and the introductions of two of the main characters. Enjoy. As always comments and criticisms&nbsp;are very welcome especially at this early&nbsp;stage.&nbsp;Under the shady side of her favorite rock, a plump brown rabbit in a half doze twitched slightly. Her eyes snapped fully open and her ears perked. A coyote? No. A faint buzz, coming closer. A sound as benign as it was alien.Her eyes, now hyper alert, watched as a vast deep shadow flowed over the arid soil. She backed more tightly into the protective arch of rock and sat impossibly still. The shadow continued forward until it washed up and over her, without incident. Trailing tightly behind the shadow, just out of the rabbits view was a massive block of metal and glass and plastic. The great bulk drifted gently by on the other side of the rabbits favorite shady rock, faint electric hum barely audible below a light summer breeze. And then it was gone. The mammoth object floated over a small hill down toward a river valley leaving no trace of its passing. The rabbit relaxed and her eyelids sagged a few times before closing in an afternoon snooze.Inside the huge object, bundles of braided cord swung with the changing angle of the hillside. They slid off one another emitting all the cacophony of flowing beach sand. The electric hum of float plates permeated every bit of the structure, but still, those tones were almost imperceptible. A deep, grating, arrhythmic growl rose above it all. Kee lay awake staring at the ceiling. His eyes drifted over to the gently swaying blackout curtains covering the single window in his quarters. Nope. Not getting back to sleep. At least not with Eliza&rsquo;s snoring echoing around in this tin can.Kee swung his legs over the edge of his bunk and quickly retracted his bare feet from the biting cold of the metal floor. The float plate liquid cooling system ran right under his tiny room. Even in late summer the floor was continually frigid. Maybe he could pick up a rug in the next town. Nothing fancy, just a simple mat to make getting out of bed easier. He tossed on a loose shirt before gingerly placing his feet back down. It had been 3:30am when they had finally closed up the large workshop door and allowed the cart to drift off to its next location. What was it now? 1:13pm. Late, but this was a travel day. It wasn&rsquo;t like they had any work to do.Kee parted the tattered strips of cloth that were supposed to be his door. They emited the usual weak bleat that signified that he was not authorized to open this particular door before flapping aside feebly. If the door worked like it was supposed to the strips would adhere to one another creating a sound, insect, and person resistant barrier. As far as he knew, the door had never worked. Maybe that was something else he could look for in the next town, a working door, or at least a weaver who knew how to fix it. Maybe he could even get it coded to recognize him. Kee stretched the sleep out of his shoulders and back, before crossing the tiny galley, reflexively tapping the switch on the coffee machine on his way to the head. Finally ready to start the day and it was already half over. He filled his mug with coffee, snatched an apple from the stabilizer and ambled through the narrow hall leading to the workshop. He stepped into his boots barefoot and left them untied. Eliza would leave half eaten food on the counter and unwashed clothes in heaps on the floor, but she would tear a strip off you if work boots crossed her prescribed borders between the workshop, the hallway, and the living quarters. Kee plopped down, leaned back in his chair, and sat there for the next hour just watching the prairie landscape roll through the gaps in the louvered windows. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you wake me?&rdquo;Eliza leaned against the metal frame that joined the hall to the workshop. She already had a cup of coffee cradled in both hands, but hadn&rsquo;t bothered to put on pants. The question seemed to be directed as much to her cup as it was to Kee. &ldquo;I thought you might want to sleep a little late. The-&rdquo;Eliza snorted her contempt and cut him off. &ldquo;Did you forget we have to test that lift before we set up? Do you want to be under it when it goes?&rdquo;Kee rolled his eyes, but couldn&rsquo;t avoid glancing at the lift in the center of the room. He let his held breath out through his nose and shrugged a small resignation.&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t put your boots on the workbenches.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good morning, Liz.&rdquo; Kee called after her, and swung his legs back down heavily to the floor. Eliza was already across the hall and heading for the stairs leading up to her room. He could hear her grunted reply echo back to him through the metal structure.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tAfter hearing the raves of many 3D artists over the last few years, I finally broke down and bought Substance Painter. The fact that it was recently discounted pretty heavily might have had something to do with it. Why I let at least two similar sales pass me by is a little less clear, even to me. Is Painter a miracle tool that instantly makes every model I create look fantastic and wins me throngs of adoring fans? No. At its heart, it is an image manipulation tool for texturing 3D objects. It speeds up and simplifies the texturing workflow, but it does nothing that couldn&rsquo;t be accomplished in Photoshop or Krita. It is more purpose bent toward 3D work, but at the end of the day it&rsquo;s still taking 2D images and messing with them so they wrap cleanly around a 3D mesh. Artists have been doing a pretty good job of that since before Jurassic Park. I&rsquo;m fairly sure that I could have kept working on textures without it, but after using it for the last couple of days, I don&rsquo;t know that I would ever want to. So, every time I wanted to change the oil in the car I could painstakingly stack up a ramp of wooden blocks to safely lift the car when I drive up on top of it, or I could buy a hydraulic jack and lift the damn thing in 30 seconds. Substance Painter is the hydraulic jack. It won&rsquo;t change the oil for me but it makes getting at the underside of the car simple and fast.After switching almost entirely to open source and free software for all my 2D and 3D art needs, the idea of buying a single purpose tool has become difficult to swallow. Krita does everything I ever needed from photoshop (better in most cases) for the high price of nothing. Blender, even with its shotgun blast of an interface, can hold it&rsquo;s own as a powerful tool for creating and animating 3D models for that same price. Why then would I ever want to pay for a tool? That was the niggling thought that made me pass up those other sales. Why would I ever need expensive software again? Granted, Substance Painter hardly qualifies as expensive software, but that is the trap all the same. I have several computers running Linux right now, a free operating system. I use free or very cheap tools for content creation. I am using one of the 3 free tools I have here to write this post. It gets to the point that paying anything for creation software becomes a difficult mental exercise. That was the very long way around to saying that Substance Painter is a really solid and good tool. If you texture 3D models, you would probably like using it.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI start counting the names on the wall. There are probably close to fifty years worth of autographs up here. Most are written in marker or ballpoint pen. There are a couple scrawled out in nail polish and lipstick. One signature is almost certainly written in mustard. At least I hope that&rsquo;s mustard. I stop counting at forty seven and start looking for names I recognize. Most are completely Indecipherable. I stop trying to read them and start looking for empty spaces. Some small patch of wall that I can write in later.I check my tie knot again cinching it slightly tighter to my collar. Suit is clean, shoes are shiny. Fly check. Fly is up. Good.&nbsp;I resist the urge to hum my set list. These dressing rooms are pretty close together and the walls might as well be made from cardboard. Better safe than sorry.&nbsp;I do a quick spin in this Ikea office chair, pushing off with my heels and tipping my head back. I take in all five oddly angled walls of the space in a radial blur. The dressing room is tiny, but a comfortable sort of close.&nbsp;There. Right there. That might be a good spot for a signature. Yeah, that little blank space beside the lamp. That will work. Later though. It would be bad luck to sign the wall before a show.&nbsp;Three gentle raps on the door. I almost miss the knock. The stage manager says something I can&rsquo;t make out, so I yank out my earbuds and toss them on the weathered chair in the corner. She repeats herself and I hear my name and &ldquo;two minutes&rdquo;.&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; I fire back reflexively keeping my voice as flat as possible. I hear her march off quickly, she&rsquo;s dealing with some crisis or other. Seems like it might be something about lighting. I fix my attention on that small empty space on the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;I rub my hands together and blow warm breath between them. It isn&rsquo;t cold in the dressing room, but I shake off a rising shiver. I used to keep count of my shows. I often think I should have jotted them all down. Like a diary or something. I didn&rsquo;t, and now the time and place of all my past engagements is completely lost to me. I would ask my accountant, but so many of the smaller joints pay in cash and sometimes stuff just doesn&rsquo;t get claimed. This feeling though is exactly the same as my first performance. I can recall that much. The chilling tension between my shoulder blades. The anxiety and a sort of low level dread. I tell myself that I have become better at shaking those feelings off, but I also know that is a complete lie. I&rsquo;m still terrified.I stand quickly, shake my arms from my shoulders down to my fingertips, stretch my lips a few times, and step over to the door. One long slow breath in and out. I reach for the door handle and walk through.&nbsp;There is only one long curving hallway in this theatre. A nice change. Some of the older rooms, as old as this place, can be downright labyrinthine. I have my suspicions that one of the theatres moved a few walls around to cover up a particularly heinous crime at one point. A few of the people who worked there thought the same. Makes it an absolute mess to navigate.I&rsquo;m about halfway to the stage when they start playing off the last act, a joke telling juggler. The music rises, The Entertainer, and my whole world just sort of ghosts out. I&rsquo;m usually on guard for this sort of thing. It&rsquo;s like a million tiny bells all struck at once. It fades quickly, but I have to stop in my tracks and close my eyes for a second. There are two stage crew that see me stop in the hall. On up by the curtain and one back a few feet. They don&rsquo;t really think much of it. One of them saw a well known actress vomit only a few feet from here recently. Not really information I wanted to know. I&rsquo;m not going to give her another vomit story though. After a quick head shake, I start forward again. Two minutes is two minutes and I don&rsquo;t like to miss curtain times.&nbsp;I keep my setlist in my pocket. Sort of a security blanket. I always write them, but the last time I actually looked at one was in England, and that was only because I didn&rsquo;t remember the words to that Pet Shop Boys song. Well, that, and I was completely off my ass. I&rsquo;m surprised I could read my own writing, let alone sing.No banter. No introductions. I leave my guitar on the stand. Stone sober, I take a deep breath. I plant my feet and break straight into Jolene.&nbsp;This does two things. First, I could sing that song in my sleep. I go on autopilot for the next couple of minutes while I adjust to the room. I close my eyes and lean into the song. Second, this is a little bit of psychological warfare. Almost everyone in the audience knows the song. Of course, there are those three guys in a booth near the back that have no clue, but most of the audience start singing along in their heads. What they aren&rsquo;t used to is hearing it sung by a baritone. This means that the most common memory rising to the surface is just Dolly Parton singing. That I can deal with. You can think of it as a sort of psychic countermeasure.If Jolene was the first punch, Creep is the follow-up. This one gets me the age of the room and gets the crowd used to hearing my voice. I mostly get echoes of music videos and a smattering of dorm room ceilings. Nothing unexpected. Where Jolene is fast with no breaks, Creep is breathy with drawn-out pauses between lyrics. Lots of space to acclimate.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve tried a lot of these combinations in the past, fast song with slow, old with new, classic with a cult hit. These two are my current openers.&nbsp;Listening to covers isn&rsquo;t why any of these people came to my show tonight. They came to hear about themselves.At one point in the past, I would come out and start to improv cold. I would pick up my guitar and just start singing to Jan the plumber about his day and how much he loves Kirk, his dog. I would leave out how he loves the dog more than he loves his girlfriend, and how she felt the same. Kirk must have been a really great dog.Some folks didn&rsquo;t get off as lucky. That girl in Boston where I sang in a sweet country twang that if she hated working for her mother so much she should probably just &ldquo;mosey off into the sunset&rdquo;. Or the Guy in Ottawa who I agreed within blazing metal ballad screech that he probably was partly responsible for his friends overdose. The cat Lady in Portage la Prairie. The veteran I brought to tears in Dayton.I was also half in the bag for most of that time. Wake up to the radio. Drink. Muzak at the grocery store. Drink. Barry Manilow on at the coffee shop. Drink. The constant low-level hum of other people's memories had become unbearable. Then the iPod came out. Dozens of hours of Buddy Rich drumming pumped straight into my ears. Probably saved my life.Now I find that if I warm up the crowd a bit, and give myself a chance to ease into it, I can give these people the fun night out they are looking for without dredging up a wave of unwanted memories.I step back from the mic without a word and lift my guitar from the stand at center stage. I twist it out of tune, just so I can spend a few seconds dialing it back in. The one-two punch worked. The entire crowd is completely silent. I can hear the kitchen staff working in the back, but otherwise, the entire joint is holding its breath. Waiting for me. Waiting to see what I will do next. They all came here thinking that what I do is a mentalist trick. This part. This part is the trick. Quieting an entire room full of people to the point that all they are thinking about is what is happening right here, right now. A man in a blue suit, rhinestones in swirling patterns on his lapels, tuning his guitar. For me, it&rsquo;s like listening to a soft breeze.&nbsp;&ldquo;How&rsquo;s everyone doing tonight?&rdquo;And that&rsquo;s how I start the show. It&rsquo;s not a question that I need an answer to. In a few moments, I will start playing the first few notes of Livin&rsquo; On A Prayer and I will know more about this guy sitting just off the left of the stage than he would ever want me to.&nbsp; I sing along making up lyrics pulled straight from his memories. Keith used to drive an Iroc and howl this album out the open windows going 90 down the highway. Judy was in the car with him, but they didn&rsquo;t last. It was a high school thing. Now he draws maps for the parks service. He wonders what could have been, but I sing that he remembers those times, but wouldn&rsquo;t trade it for what he&rsquo;s got now. It&rsquo;s not a lie, but he and I both know it&rsquo;s not entirely the truth. We leave it at that.I hop down from the stage and switch over to my wireless mic pack. I heard something a little earlier and go out looking for one lady in particular. A couple of notes into I Want it That Way and Nancy lights up like a christmas tree.&nbsp;I sing about how she left med school to start her own bakery. She could have succeeded at either but the bakery is how she met Claire. Claire blushes and squeezes Nancy&rsquo;s hand a little tighter. I sing about their son Matthew, but I don&rsquo;t use his name. When I belt out their chorus and get down on one knee Claire bursts into happy tears. Nancy holds their clasped hands up so the rest of the audience can see their engagement rings.&nbsp;I finish the song, congratulate them, and head back up toward the stage. I pause for a half step, pivot, and make my way into the crowd.&nbsp;There is Troy, originally from Barbados but lived most of his life in Jamaica and Denver. I start into a generic reggae riff but quickly roll into Black Magic Woman. I&rsquo;m a few lines in when I see Brenda&rsquo;s eyes grow wide as she realizes I&rsquo;m singing to her and not her husband. Brenda and Troy shake their heads in bewilderment and share bright smiles as I recount chunks of their life together. I leave out a lot, and I get a few things wrong on purpose. I don&rsquo;t mention their 30 year old daughter. I can&rsquo;t quite place her name or her battle with what might be bipolar disorder. They could use some help, but I really don&rsquo;t know how, so I move on.Pop ballads, punk, ska, Sharon Lois and Bram, two guys off to the right with nothing but I Love it Loud by Kiss running through their heads.And there it is. 57 minutes into an hour-long show. A few notes from True Colors and he ignites like a bonfire.Walter, 34, beating a young man and leaving him on a curb. Mexico City. No that was later. Brazil. Rio. The young man, a kid really, doesn&rsquo;t seem responsive. Walter suspects he may be dead. No one saw. Walter has never told anyone. Only he knows what happened over ten years ago. And now I do too.I put my guitar back on the stand, finishing off &ldquo; beautiful, like a rainbow.&rdquo; unaccompanied. The young couple I was singing too hold each other a little closer.&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you, everyone. Enjoy the rest of your night.&rdquo;Whistles, cheers, and applause.The lights drop and I make my way back to my dressing room. I can hear the MC announcing the next act, as I close the door and quickly jam the earbuds back into my ears.I sit for a long time staring at that spot on the wall where I will write my name. Examining the shape of it. I&rsquo;ll add my signature in a moment, but first I fire up some Buddy Rich and silence the world for a while.&nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Scary Games - Half-Life 2, Doom 3, Aliens vs. Predator -1999Half-Life 2 does so many things right. It is a fantastic action game that tells most of it&rsquo;s story though the environment. The set pieces are satisfying and seem to have a purpose in the world. It can make you feel fragile and powerful all at once. It&rsquo;s really just a great example of what can be done in the first person shooter genre. It is also terrifying. There is a discomfort woven into the fabric of Half-Life 2 that gnaws at you long after you shut it down. There are areas of flat out, jack in the box jump scares, but when the adrenaline stops pumping, you are left with a sense of crushing dread and hopelessness that few games are able to match. Sure a leaping, spider like, headcrab is immediately terrifying, but the implications of wretched stalkers, humans reduced to barely living automatons, is truly the stuff of nightmares.Then there was Doom 3, a game that&rsquo;s mechanics are honed to a fine edge, but is probably best known for its unrelenting tension. For something like 15 hours this game just never lets up. At every turn monsters lunge at you from the dark. Doom 3, somewhat fairly, is often criticized for leaning too hard on monster closets. Small rooms and dark corridors that exist for no other reason than to house leaping ghouls. Eventually it became fatiguing, but no game before or since has had me as constantly on edge.One time, with all the lights out and headphones on, I played the Human campaign of the 1999 Aliens vs. Predator. I was roughly half way through the game and had already been scared several times. I had wandered into a lab with one exit when suddenly all hell broke loose. Aliens started attacking from the doorway, the ceiling, and the floor all at once. I tore through all of my ammo and ran like a panicked rabbit in a white knuckle battle, finally coming out on top. Severely injured, but alive. I was just beginning to catch my breath and started heading for the door, when a face hugger dropped from the roof and finished me off. In a flash of terror, I shut down the game, uninstalled it, took out the disc and put it in a drawer. This was the first and only game that literally scared the &lsquo;play&rsquo; out of me.You might notice that all of these games are shooters, and not the go to for horror games, survival horror. I played Amnesia and something about the movement and camera angle made me motion sick. I couldn&rsquo;t really play it in a darkened room, or for long stretches so it never had the opportunity to sink it&rsquo;s scary hooks into me. Also, I&rsquo;m sort of a weakling and not really into repetitive jump scares. I also don&rsquo;t really find the concept of ghosts very frightening, so most of the atmosphere of those games doesn&rsquo;t work on me like it is supposed to. Someday I&rsquo;ll get around to playing Alien Isolation and I will probably be very scared. Maybe next year I can add some more to the Best Scary Games list.\t\t"

You been using this motor in salt water or estuary environments Tom?Caller(m)(Tom)I- Sometimes, yeah.GCThese little chinese motors Tom. They just aren’t made to keep out the salt water. What happens is the salt just gets in there and eats at the contacts. Have you checked the contacts Tom?Caller(m)(Tom)Yeah- I- no.GCI suggest checking those contacts, even up at the battery enclosure. Salt water gets in there and just eats away at it. You can probably clean it up gently with some vinegar and get it running smooth again but you’re gonna want to look into getting an aftermarket seal or a bit beefier motor that has protection against salt water. Okay Tom?Caller(m)(Tom)Yeah- um- okay. Thanks Glenn. I’ll check that out.GCNo Problem. Thanks for calling.(disconnection) Alright, before we take our next caller, I just want to remind everyone that Linda is home sick today, so I’m running the lines myself. If I don’t get to your question I apologize. Also I’m not going to be able to hear your questions ahead of time, so when I pick up you will be live on the air. Please don’t make me regret it (laughter). Also please try to have your questions ready and let me know who you are. You know how we like to keep it friendly over here. Alright.

I was wondering what you thought about that?GCI do have some thoughts on that. Thanks for your question Ross.Caller(m)(Ross)Yeah thanks right.GC(disconnection) Okay. Alright. We are going to get into this more in the next segment but I’m going to give you all a little preview. I’ll just be straight with you. I don’t like it. This smells like a money grab plain and simple. I will have Kenny Lake from Kenny’s Lakes tuesdays on the Great Wide Open Network here with me to close out the hour. We’ll both get into it then and really shake this one out. I know this though. I don’t like it. But like I said we can cover that later when I have Kenny on the phone. Right now we have to pay some bills.Station IDCommercial breakGCHello. We are back and I am taking your calls.

I really can’t tell you all how much I love all these great people I work with. They really went all out on this one. Good job folks, but someone has to get back to work around here.

    "content": "\t\t\t\tA short little story. October is the month for scary things, so I thought this little idea that I had been playing with might fit.&nbsp;From crevasses and the dim crooks of tree roots we creep. From behind loose mounds of soil. From between the gaps of interlocked stones, careful not to disturb their delicate balance. For now. With dainty weaves and rolls we edge forward. And down. An unseen trickle beneath cover and shadow. Then a grain of sand is pressed free. Inertia broken. We add it to our unending crawl. New mass to unstick others from their place. Soon there is a rivulet of grit dragging against the base of pebbles and stones. The stones are lifted by our motion, buoyed upon countess crystalline teeth. We reverberate with the soft low hum of grinding silica. In time, more stones are joined to our effort. The hum becomes a growl. Our growl grows strong and vulgar. Grasses and flowers that we were once compelled to mince around, are now brought down and consumed by our accumulated bulk. We add cellulose fiber and oily paste to our own relentless flow. Now saplings and shrubs are bent and buried and torn from their purchase. Chunks of surface sedimentary and metamorphic begin to scrape and shift answering our call. They are grappled and devoured, augment&nbsp;to our unceasing motion. Our growl has become a roar. Deep and angry and hungry. We claw and tear at the trunks of mountain pines, stripping their bark and pummeling the bare wood until they finally acquiesces and tip to our will. The widespread roots we sheltered beneath are wrenched from the stoic rock bringing volumes of dirt and stone with them. With unstoppable power we scream downward, demanding that everything in our path surrender to us. To become us. Many tons matter are we. Blood and bone mingle with our tide of stone. Small darting things that flee our onslaught are destroyed. Far too slowly they move. Ground down to component materials. Lubricant to savage machinery. It is not with malice but resolution that we close on structures of wood and metal and glass. Small things flow from them silent compared to our rising timbre. Still compared to our deluge of movement. They become us. Hastened and absorbed. Embraced. We continue forward. No obstacles impede us. Nothing can slow our persistence. On we march to flatten mountains and displace lakes. Continents and oceans will relent to our force and only the morning will remain to witness what we have done.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Books - The Broken Earth series by N.K. JemisinWhen I started doing Best Games posts, it was in an effort to advocate for good things. There so very many folks who like nothing more than to hate on stuff and, in the sphere of video games, the bad review has, and continues to be, a source of joy for that crowd. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I have enjoyed some bad reviews. One of my favorite reviews ever compares FMV submarine adventure game Silent Steel unfavorably to the small pleasures of playing with a dry roasted peanut. It wasn&rsquo;t the hate that made me like that bit of writing. It was the humour and the subtly implied acceptance that reviewing video games is, at heart, a silly profession. Being funny, playfully funny, isn&rsquo;t simple. It takes work, practice, and a true love of the subject matter you are lampooning. Hating on a bad game isn&rsquo;t funny. It isn&rsquo;t fun. Regardless of the quality of the game, people put time and effort into it. Someone loved that concept enough to make it real. Just hating it is lazy. When faced with the product of someone else&rsquo;s creative work, hate is insufficient. At least try to be clever. I chose when I started Best Games to only champion things I thought that other people might love. I never intended to write reviews, or make value judgement. I only ever meant to describe things that I love and the reasons why I loved them, in the hope that you would find a way to love those things too.I suppose I should say something about these books too. So The Broken Earth series is the X-Men and The Road and maybe The Notebook. It&rsquo;s comic books and video games and Sci-fi wrapped in the horrors and triumphs of all human history. The characters are all deeply, messily, human and constantly contradict themselves mid-thought. The writing is beautiful and terrifying and immediate. Just go read it. Just go read all of it and share the love of good things. &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - QixThere are very few games that are so distilled, so conceptually pure, that adding anything at all reduces them. They become less perfect. Less good. Qix is the concept of risk versus reward manifest in vivid geometric patterns and the angry humming cracks of high voltage. The goal of Qix is to corral lightning. A beautiful but chaotic creature, the Qix, dominates the playfield. Every aspect of its design and movement speaks danger. A thing to be avoided. The game then forces you to enter into the domain of the Qix by sending unshakable pursuers down the digital fences you create. Pause even slightly, and new harassers form behind you. You must always move forward. The game gives you one choice. Would you move fast, or slow. That is all. Retreat from direct conflict with the Qix is not an option. The longer your line, the more fence you dare to lay out in an attempt to pen in the Qix, the higher the risk. One touch from the Qix delivers an audio visual concussion of screeching static. Failure is not ambiguous. During future attempts to cage this monster, you will have no choice but to be cautious.Future attempts to reproduce, spin off, rip off, or riff on Qix, have been&hellip; unsatisfactory. There are a great many games that try to replicate the core of Qix, but the crystalline simplicity of the original remains astounding.Qix is perfect, and it is one of the best games.       \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI have changed the enemy system to use a combination of NavMesh and internal collision avoidance. The enemies can still be knocked around using the physics system and they can overshoot targets when they have built up too much inertia. So they can now navigate any level layout pretty reliably, but they still act like idiots if you fake them out, or push them around. I have started rebuilding player attacks alongside setting up the game controls. Using the Unity asset Rewired has helped a ton, but there are still a lot of fidgety things to deal with if you want to support a bunch of different controllers. XboxOne and 360 controls work fine so far. I have a generic gamepad and it needs a bit extra tweaking to work properly. Still have to test ps3-ps4 etc. The player can select between different characters, but I only have the one set up for testing. I&rsquo;ll have to add more when the enemies attacks are more consistent and they have more special case behaviours, like deciding to push the player toward the nearest hole or edge. &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tDone. Well sort of done. I wanted to write a story where two people go for a walk. That's it. No heroics. No omens. No moral. No lessons learned. Just a walk. In a cave with a monster. So far, what I have been writing are sort of story stubs. Some small bit of concept or character that could be expanded into a better story, by a better writer (I'm talking to you future Owen, get on it). I think there are a few more story stubs I want to work on before writing something larger and more intricate. Until then, here you go.The line shuffled forward a few steps and Kaitlin shuffled with them. She was fairly sure that she had forgotten how her knees worked. Was she being awkward? Maybe? Oh god, she was. She absolutely was being the most awkward. All she had to do was walk a few steps and not act like a doofus. Hundreds of times, many hundreds of times, she had stood in this same line in front of this same counter in this same coffee shop waiting for the same low V-neck wearing barista taking his slow ass time. Sometimes she felt tired or irritable, sometimes she felt rushed and overextended, but never awkward. Now she was feeling judgemental and guilty for feeling judgemental. Or maybe she just felt anxious. Did it show? Could Malcolm tell? He totally could. How could he not? Anxious was leaking out of her pores. She pressed her arms a little tighter to her sides so the smell of anxious couldn&rsquo;t escape from her armpits.&ldquo;Busy this morning.&rdquo; Malcolm's voice sounded so calm and easy. How could he be so comfortable when she couldn&rsquo;t remember how to stand like a person. And he smelled so good. Just a simple clean soap smell with maybe a touch of wood, like sawdust. His smell this close to her made her tongue feel dry. How was that fair.Kaitlin felt the words &ldquo;Yeah, right?&rdquo; croak from her throat as she looked up at his face. Malcolm's bright half smile, the deep brown of his cheeks, and those gorgeous almost black almond eyes. Not. Fair. At. All. The line shuffled forward again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you- we- could, you know, finally make it out- get together.&rdquo; Malcolm sounded a little less smooth just then. Kaitlin could feel her heart slow to a manageable rhythm. At least some part of him might be close to her level. Stumbling over a few words didn&rsquo;t stop him from being so damned pretty though. He added &ldquo;I mean Medicine is demanding, right? Like timewise and workwise.&rdquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only first year, but yeah I guess so. Engineering can&rsquo;t be so super easy either.&rdquo; Kaitlin could feel her cheeks warming. She just hoped against hope that she didn&rsquo;t look like a frickin tomato. This was the longest she had ever talked to Malcolm without the buffer of a group of mutual friends. Maggie had told her that she heard from Lane &ldquo;that if Kaitlin asked Malcolm to go for coffee, that he would for sure say yes&rdquo;. It was all very junior high, but it still sent Kaitlin&rsquo;s stomach into backflips. Then she had gone up and asked him at Janice and Dean&rsquo;s house party, well her and two beers had gone up and asked him. She felt floaty and &nbsp;hadn&rsquo;t been sure that it was real, but here they were, saturday morning, standing in line for coffee. Together. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in civil, so I spent the last couple months reading about asphalt. Mostly we just memorize equations and play a lot of basketball&rdquo; He said, laughing it off and looking up to the menu board. &ldquo;Same. Well, except it&rsquo;s anatomy and tennis for me.&rdquo;&ldquo;Tennis? I tried badminton, but I never played tennis before.&rdquo;&ldquo;We should!&rdquo; Kaitlin felt her voice jump in volume and she wrestled it back down. &ldquo;I mean, if you wanted to try it out sometime, I could- I would be happy to teach you&rdquo; Kaitlin fought off images of long brown legs and short white shorts. She closed the invitation with a weak grin.&ldquo;Maybe for a second, or third date?&rdquo; Malcolm had replaced that half smile with a sly sideways glance.If she didn&rsquo;t look like a tomato before, there was no way she didn&rsquo;t now. That heat had spread from her cheeks to the tips of her ears. The line shuffled forward and they found themselves in front of the counter. Together. Captain V-neck barely focused on them, wiped his hands across his &lsquo;Burks&rsquo; apron, and tossed off a bored &ldquo;So what&rsquo;ll you have?&rdquo;Kaitlin was devoting an unreasonable amount of attention to the warm latte in her hands. She studied the tiny puckered pinholes in the lid. The the wisps of steam that drifted up and away into the crisp october air. None of it was interesting in the slightest, but she made a real effort to keep her eyes locked on that lid. People don&rsquo;t die of nervous embarrassment do they?They started talking about school, since that was easy neutral territory. They both asked the same simple, customary questions, and gave the same, simple, rote answers. It felt to Kaitlin like they were participating in a conversational ritual with no clear goal, but it was better than the alternative. She was mostly thinking about just sinking into the cracks of the concrete and disappearing entirely. She kept her mouth moving so by the time they had walked the two blocks from the coffee shop to the river path, Kaitlin could feel herself relaxing a bit.She started to realize how fast she had been walking and slowed enough to take in the orange and yellow crested trees. Malcolm slowed with her.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty down here.&rdquo; He said, stopping to regard a group of vibrant poplars.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice place to run. Lots of people, but it&rsquo;s not usually crowded.&rdquo; It had been weeks since Kaitlin had gone on a proper run, but she wasn&rsquo;t going to say that out loud. Besides, it wasn&rsquo;t a lie. She really did like this stretch of the river path. She looked up at Malcolm while he closed his eyes and took a deep breath of cool air. Maybe this was going okay. She hadn&rsquo;t felt like a complete disaster in at least four minutes. He had laughed at her jokes. That had to be a good sign.&ldquo;You live close, right? Maggie said you live on this side of town.&rdquo;Kaitlin was startled and felt her eyes involuntarily snap skyward. Had she been staring? Maybe. Did Malcolm catch her staring? Maybe. &ldquo;Uh&rdquo; Kaitlin uttered. Seemed an easy enough question, but it took a second for her brain to change gears and process it. &ldquo;Um. Yeah. Yeah. We live just over there. Like three blocks from Burks.&rdquo;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s convenient, for running I mean. I live way east. Past the university. It&rsquo;s all just copies of the same couple of houses. Nicest place over there is the parks between the &lsquo;burbs.&rdquo; He smiled as Kaitlin walked her eyes back over to his. She could feel herself smiling back and only a little warm in the cheeks this time.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know much of the city. I just moved here for school.&rdquo; Kaitlin trailed off. She felt like there was nothing interesting she could add after that, and her smile faded. The last thing she wanted to do was bore Malcolm with small town stories. Of course, he went and asked anyway, because that was the ritual, right?&ldquo;Oh yeah? Where are you from?&rdquo;They quickly drifted back into that same question/answer pattern, but more relaxed, maybe a bit more sincere. They strolled past dozens of mid morning joggers and cyclists trying to shake off a week of sitting on their butts. The air was warming as the sun slowly rose in the sky. When they came to a small bend in the river path Kaitlin stopped short to take in the view. Shafts of sunlight were streaming through the trees and tiny spikes of gold formed on the ripples in the river. &ldquo;That deserves a picture.&rdquo; Kaitlin breathed, and slid her phone from her pocket. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold your coffee&rdquo; Malcolm offered. She handed him the cup and took a couple quick shots. It seemed like maybe she was missing an opportunity here.&ldquo;Want one with us in it? I can send it to you.&rdquo; She asked&ldquo;Yeah. That&rsquo;s a good idea.&rdquo;Kaitlin stepped back off the path and felt the warmth of Malcolm sliding in behind her as he moved into frame. She was starting to hold it together. Only a tiny bit of her felt like sinking into the soil and blending in with the tree roots. He brought his face up beside hers and she tried to get both of them and the trees behind into one balanced photo. Click. She really didn&rsquo;t feel like moving though. This was nice, just like this. &ldquo;Here you go.&rdquo; Malcolm brought her cup up into view and she reached for it with her free hand. Her fingers wrapped over his and she looked up at her phone screen just in time to see Malcolm&rsquo;s beautiful eyes, now fully wide with surprise, slide out of view over her shoulder. She gripped hard as she felt his hand slipping away, both of them crushing the remnants of the latte into warm spray. She felt herself being pulled down by the hand, then the shoulder, then the ground dropped from underneath her. She was being yanked down, butt first, still clinging to Malcolm&rsquo;s hand. She opened her mouth in panic, but her voice was absent. Kaitlin&rsquo;s phone, still locked in selfie position, lit up in her hand. Her ringtone &ldquo;Yakety Sax&rdquo; barked out at her. She snapped up to sitting, her spine rigid. She had to detangle her other hand from something to mash at the face of the phone. Instinctively, she answered the call and slapped the phone to speaker mode.&ldquo;Hel-wha-Who? What is- Who is this?&rdquo;&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t move.&rdquo; A calm, businesslike voice. Female maybe? The voice echoed like whoever it was, they were speaking to Kaitlin through a culvert. &ldquo;What? Why? What?&rdquo; She felt immobilized from the tongue down. Kaitlin wasn&rsquo;t sure she could move even if she hadn&rsquo;t felt scared out of her mind.&ldquo;Sorry to interrupt. I&rsquo;m Gina and I was wondering if you might need some help.&rdquo;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Kaitlin screamed into the phone.&ldquo;Who is that? What-&rdquo; Malcolm screamed up at her. Or maybe he was screaming at the phone, it was hard to tell. Either way, she flinched when she noticed his face lying right beside her hip. For a second there, she had forgotten that he existed. No, that can&rsquo;t be right. Some hollow static from the phone cut her off mid thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry that I interrupted. I just wanted to know if you might need some assistance. Kaitlin Doyle and Malcolm Aldridge, is it?&rdquo; The voice on the phone pattered back at her. The sound of Kaitlin&rsquo;s name caught her attentions. That was something real she could latch onto. &ldquo; I just want you to stay put for a second while I access your accounts.&rdquo;&ldquo;What accounts?&rdquo; Malcolm spluttered.&ldquo;What accounts?&rdquo; Kaitlin parroted.&ldquo;If you could just hold on for one second, and again, please try not to move.&rdquo;There didn&rsquo;t seem to be anything Kaitlin could do at the moment. Gina, the voice on the phone was saying to stay put. Her legs were in total agreement, so they stayed frozen to the ground. Looking. She could probably look around? That didn&rsquo;t count as moving right?So she looked around. Aside from her phone screen there seemed to be a dim red orange light filling the cavern. Okay, cavern! That was a thing! This definitely looked like a cavern. A big one. What else, what else? Stone floor. Smooth stone floor. Tile? Nope. Bigger. Huge stone blocks, mostly smooth with cracks and imperfections. So stone that has worn smooth, not stone that has been machined smooth. Okay. Good, good. Malcolm! There he was. Lying flat on the stone, head lifted, eyes wide. He didn&rsquo;t look very calm. Rapid breathing, dilated pupils. Maybe a panic attack? He&rsquo;s not looking back at Kaitlin. He was looking straight ahead at something directly behind her. What? She turned her head and glanced over her shoulder. Nope.Not ready for that yet. What else, what else? Some dirt on the stone floor. Hmm, dirt? A puddle. Water? No, it&rsquo;s spilled coffee from Malcolm&rsquo;s cup. So not water. What wears stone smooth? Running water. But if it were running water or a creek the stone would be wet and there shouldn&rsquo;t be dirt. Okay, that&rsquo;s sorted. She should probably check again. She didn&rsquo;t really see what she saw, right?A nice slow turn of the head. Nothing flashy. Just a gradual gaze. Really take it all in. Yeah. Still there. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; Malcolm whispers the question, but Kaitlin understands every nuance of that one syllable. It&rsquo;s not just &ldquo;what am I looking at?&rdquo; - it is that, but not only that. It&rsquo;s &lsquo;what&rsquo; to everything. What is this place? What are we doing? What happened? What is happening? Kaitlin reached out to Malcolm&rsquo;s hand again. There is no infatuated fumbling. There is no heart stopping, electric moment of contact. She needs an anchor. She can tell by his &ldquo;What?&rdquo; that he needs one too. Her fingers mesh with his and she whispers back an answer.&ldquo;Yeah. It&rsquo;s a giant skeleton.&rdquo;Kaitlin tilted her head, marking out a long slow oval with her chin. She probably could have seen just as well only moving her eyes, but the ridiculous enormity of the thing seemed to warrant some neck movement. It was maybe a block or so away from them. Were city blocks a useful metric in a cavern? Didn&rsquo;t matter. Kaitlin knew blocks and so blocks it was. The skeleton must have been 12 meters tall, with arms splayed out at least twice that wide. Oh, wait. It was only the top half of a giant skeleton. The bottom half disappeared down in some sort of hole. There was steam or gas belching from the pit, tinted in red orange like the rest of the cavern. She figured it must be a volcanic vent or geyser, but something about it didn&rsquo;t seem entirely natural. The whole scene looked staged like an amusement park ride. Meaning what? The Skeleton wasn&rsquo;t real? It was real, but it was stuck? It was climbing out of the hole? Maybe it had fallen in. Maybe it had been put in. In any case, the part that was visible was only half of the thing. Amusement park. That notion came rushing back through Kaitlin&rsquo;s head. Why? Something wasn&rsquo;t right. Giant Skeletons are not normal, sure, but this tableau smelled false. What was it? Skull, orbital bones, Zygomatic Process, mandible, C4-5-6-7, Clavicle, scapula, humerus. Human. It was a human skeleton, but on a massive scale. She could name and label every single bone. Nothing surprising there, aside from the size of the thing. It took a moment to click. The skeleton was moving. A slow gyrating dance that repeated every couple of seconds. Not really a threatening display, but unsettling in a metronomic sort of way. There it was. The part that really gave Kaitlin the willies. Every single one of the dozens of visible bones was absolutely crawling with human scale skeletons. The left humerus of the thing was composed of 6 - no - 8 regular human skeletons crawling, moving, and gyrating in their own unique rhythmic pattern. All of them gripping onto the hands or feet or ribcage of the skeleton next to them. The entire surface of every single bone writhed and undulated like liquid. Kaitlin felt slightly dizzy, and looked at the ground for a while.&ldquo;Hello? Are you still there? I apologize for the delay. I had a little trouble pulling up your accounts. Seems that they are very new. Like &lsquo;today&rsquo; new. They are still being filled in. What are you two doing?&rdquo; The phone signal had cleared up significantly , but Gina sounded confused. Kaitlin figured there was more than enough confusion on her own end of the phone and she didn&rsquo;t really need to be getting more of it from elsewhere.&ldquo;Well. I think maybe I&rsquo;m looking at a giant skeleton. Like three stories tall. Might be made of smaller skeletons. A lot of them. Other than that, not much. You?&rdquo; Kaitlin placed her own tone at somewhere between caustic and simmering rage. &ldquo;Yeah. Sorry about that. You&rsquo;re really not supposed to be there.&rdquo;&ldquo;Ya think!&rdquo; Malcolm Bellowed. He snapped up to standing, completely neglecting to let go of Kaitlin&rsquo;s hand first. With one hand in Malcolm&rsquo;s and the other gripping her phone that left no hands to stop her from toppling forward and bouncing off the stone floor. It might have been worn smooth, but it was still stone, and it still hurt.&ldquo;Ow! What the hell?&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh my god. I&rsquo;m so sorry. Are you okay?&rdquo; Malcolm stooped back down to help Kaitlin to her feet. She could see the genuine concern in those dark eyes, but even that wasn&rsquo;t enough to thoroughly drain her of confused, directionless, anger. She had some left to vent, so she scowled back at him as convincingly as she could. Everything she wanted from today was slipping away from her. She wasn&rsquo;t even sure what it was that she wanted, but falling into a cave populated by a massive skeleton creature wasn&rsquo;t part of it. She was pretty certain of that. Kaitlin took a second to brush the dust off her jeans, her new pullover, and attempt to organise her tangle of red-brown hair into something bordering on presentable. She noted that both she and Malcolm kept their feet rooted to the spot. Not even a tiny shuffle. He kept all of his focus on the skeleton, and conspicuously away from Kaitlin. Gina chimed in from parts unknown. &ldquo;Is everything okay? You didn&rsquo;t move anywhere did you?&rdquo;&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Kaitlin and Malcolm fired back simultaneously. &ldquo;Good. Good. This guy has decent range, but terrible awareness. No eyes, can&rsquo;t hear. &nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t look like he even knows you&rsquo;re there. Still, if you get much closer he&rsquo;ll sense you and you&rsquo;ll pull aggro for sure.&rdquo; Gina spoke in a halfhearted singsong like everything she was saying was completely obvious.&ldquo;Wait. What? Did you say pull aggro? What do you mean, pull aggro?&rdquo; Kaitlin responded and tossed a sheepish look at Malcolm.&ldquo;You know what she&rsquo;s talking about?&rdquo; The stiffness seemed to lift from him as he spoke.&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; Kaitlin sucked the breath in through her teeth and winced slightly. &ldquo;So&hellip; what does that mean?&rdquo;Kaitlin sighed. This was it. She was outed as a dork for sure now. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a game thing. In my second year of pre-med, I almost lost a semester playing this game. An MMO. It was the only game I could get to run on my laptop. I played it with a bunch of friends. You wander around this fantasy world as wizards and stuff and, you know, fight monsters.&rdquo; Kaitlin pointed gingerly toward the hulking heap of gyrating bones in the distance, &ldquo;Like this guy. Pull aggro, means if we get closer it will attack us.&rdquo; &ldquo;My brother and I only ever had consoles&rdquo; Malcolm gaped at the skeleton, fully taking it in for the first time. &ldquo;But I know what you mean.&rdquo; He raised his voice slightly, speaking mostly to Gina over the phone. &ldquo;So are you saying that this is some sort of game? Are we in a game right now?&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh. No. No this isn&rsquo;t a game. This is real. I suppose you could say this is the source material.&rdquo; They could hear the frustration in Gina&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;So you two really should have gone through the tutorials. I just work on the help line. You know, like &lsquo;tips and tricks&rsquo; that sort of thing. You are both way underleveled for this encounter, and you are both specced as support classes. I don&rsquo;t even know how you got partied up without a fighter or ranged class. Why were you together at the gate anyway?&rdquo;&ldquo;Umm,&rdquo; Kaitlin found herself turning to look into Malcolm&rsquo;s eyes as she spoke. She didn&rsquo;t know if she needed confirmation or confidence or just an ally. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re, um, we were on a date?&rdquo;To Kaitlin&rsquo;s relief Malcolm nodded and returned her gaze. &ldquo;Yeah. Yeah, a date.&rdquo;&ldquo;WHAT?!? Well no wonder you&rsquo;re in here!&rdquo; The sudden volume of Gina&rsquo;s voice snapped them both out their reverie. &ldquo;This was my first call of the day, and you&rsquo;re both on a date with a party member! This is why people are supposed to go through the tutorial! I have to submit a ticket to admissions now, but I can&rsquo;t because I have to get you two out of this encounter first. Okay. Okay. Let&rsquo;s just all calm down.&rdquo;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re calm. I think? Are we calm?&rdquo; Kaitlin replied, doing her best impression of a calm person while keeping one eye on the colossal pile of wriggling bones.&ldquo;Sure. Yep, we can be calm. Placid even.&rdquo; Malcolm chorused in. &ldquo;Hmm, okay.&rdquo; They could hear the sound of drink sipping and glasses being placed on a desktop over the phone. &ldquo;Okay. We can do this. Alright. Lets see. That big guy over there is Gashadokuro. Like I said before, his perception is very poor but his attack range covers most of the cave. He shouldn&rsquo;t be able to climb out of that hole, so I don&rsquo;t think you have to worry about him chasing you. Let me pull up the drawings of the encounter space.&rdquo;Malcolm looked quizzical and asked &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a Gash -a duke, doke, toka. What?&rdquo;Gina quickly transitioned into a practiced speech like a museum curate or tour guide. &ldquo;Gashadokuro is a japanese variant of the bone golem, or giant skeleton. There are 15 or 16 of them around the world. We have Gashadokuro here on an exchange from Arashiyama. They have the Wendigo there for the next three years. We&rsquo;ve run exchange programs since the 50&rsquo;s, but this is one of the biggest construction sites since the Han Dragon. The whole Gashadokuro cave was moved stone by stone over four months. It&rsquo;s really quite impressive. Okay. I have a path for you. So, do you want the good news or the bad news?&rdquo;Kaitlin eyed Malcolm. He took in a deep breath and blinked heavily like he was trying to shake off a dizzy spell. She could feel herself doing the same.&ldquo;Good?&rdquo; Kaitlin asked with dread.&ldquo;There is a path most of the way around that skirts his projected zone of perception. You just have to hug the left wall of the cavern when you exit the entrance area, and don&rsquo;t move more than about a meter and a half from the wall all the way around. So hug the wall, stay out of his perception range, and you should be able to reach the exit without fighting.&rdquo;There was a short silence before Malcolm asked &ldquo;And the bad news?&rdquo;&ldquo;You have to move slow, like nothing faster than a leisurely walk, so the path to the exit will take almost two hours. Also, there is a spot at the end where the rock juts out. There is no way that he doesn&rsquo;t see you when you reach that point. It&rsquo;s also within his attack range and neither of you has earned a weapon or any defensive equipment. So, okay, are you ready for this?&rdquo; Gina didn&rsquo;t wait to find out if they were ready. &ldquo;When you hit that spot, you&rsquo;ll know it when you get to it, you are going to have to run. Like I mean run. You will have to flat out sprint to the exit. But good news again, the exit is only about one hundred seventy meters from there. So the path is this; slow, slow, slow, book it. Sound doable?&rdquo;&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we just go back the way we came in?&rdquo; Malcolm said.&ldquo;Nope. That path is closed, besides it&rsquo;s straight up and no one is carrying any climbing gear. The cave exit is really the only route. I can talk you through it.&rdquo;Kaitlin gulped back a breath. She suddenly pictured last night vividly, listening to music on her phone while she reviewed the muscles of the forearm. She remembered lifting her head from the book sometime later, shutting off the music, and dragging herself off to bed. &ldquo;Oh. No. Oh no. I didn&rsquo;t plug in my phone.&rdquo;Malcolm looked confused and rubbed his knuckles along his temple. &ldquo;What. Okay. Why? Why does that matter.&rdquo; Half a beat later. &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh, okay.&rdquo; Gina chimed in with a practiced reassurance that only slightly sounded false. &ldquo;How long do you have left?&rdquo;&ldquo;10%.&rdquo;&ldquo;Well that won&rsquo;t last two hours. Malcolm?&rdquo;&ldquo;I- I forgot my phone at home.&rdquo; &ldquo;Okay then. You&rsquo;ll just have to do the best you can, and I&rsquo;ll talk to you again when you reach the other end. One last time, slow and tight to the wall. When the rock forces you close to him you run for the exit. It&rsquo;s a massive wooden gate just on the other side of Gashadokuro. You won&rsquo;t be able to miss it.&rdquo;Kaitlin moved to end the call and heard Gina chime in one last time. &ldquo;One last thing. Remember this. We&rsquo;ve had people running these encounters for over a century and in the last decade we&rsquo;ve only lost four parties.&rdquo;&ldquo;Is that supposed to make us less frightened?&rdquo; countered Kaitlin.&ldquo;No. I just don&rsquo;t want you two showing up on my performance record. You&rsquo;d better get going.&rdquo; The connection cut off from the other end.&ldquo;Well, you ready?&rdquo; Malcolm asked offering his hand.&ldquo;Not even close. You?&rdquo;&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;Kaitlin slid her hand into his and squeezed slightly. Her hand was probably just as clammy and trembling as his. Malcolm didn&rsquo;t seem to care. He returned the squeeze and nodded. &ldquo;I suppose we were going for a walk this morning.&rdquo; Kaitlin could feel some heat rush back into her cheeks. She probably did look like a freckled tomato. The thought of that was less embarrassing for some reason.&ldquo;A walk and a run I guess. Sounds like fun.&rdquo; Malcolm grinned and some sparkle returned to those deep dark eyes. They stepped off of the entrance platform, carefully keeping to the left wall, and walked hand in hand. Gashadokuro continued his rhythmic dance, looming in the distance, apparently unaware of the young couple moving slowly and talking quietly along the edge of his cave.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThis is Changelog 0001. I&rsquo;m creating a new series of posts that should go up at least once a week. Changelog will be a quick writeup on the state of game development over here. It&rsquo;s more for myself than anyone else, though you are welcome to read it. Just a simple entry describing any changes, additions, or struggles to/with game projects I&rsquo;m working on. Occasionally words will be accompanied by pictures or videos. Won&rsquo;t that be nice.For example:&#8203;Having recently solidifying a convincing &ldquo;ball rolling effect&rdquo; script, I set about trying to make the AI enemies in my game attempt some level of collision avoidance while stalking the player. Today I got a very clunky, but consistent collision avoidance system working. I will have to go back in and improve it, but for combat testing purposes, it should work fine. Next up is to have the enemies attack the player, rather than just try to shove them off the edge of the world &lsquo;Sumo&rsquo; style. Currently they just aren&rsquo;t very dangerous and can be tricked into flinging themselves off the world fairly easily. I&rsquo;ll have to add a little self preservation into the collision avoidance system. And there you go. That is a changelog. Now I can look back here in a couple of months and feel either good or bad that I did or didn&rsquo;t progress. Won&rsquo;t that be nice.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI thought that maybe this would be that last entry, but it looks like there will probably be one more. If you have been waiting for the end, you can probably skip this iteration.&nbsp;The line shuffled forward a few steps and Kaitlin shuffled with them. She was fairly sure that she had forgotten how her knees worked. Was she being awkward? Maybe? Oh god, she was. She absolutely was being the most awkward. All she had to do was walk a few steps and not act like a doofus. Hundreds of times, many hundreds of times, she had stood in this same line in front of this same counter in this same coffee shop waiting for the same low V-neck wearing barista taking his slow ass time. Sometimes she felt tired or irritable, sometimes she felt rushed and overextended, but never awkward. Now she was feeling judgemental and guilty for feeling judgemental. Or maybe she just felt anxious. Did it show? Could Malcolm tell? He totally could. How could he not? Anxious was leaking out of her pores. She pressed her arms a little tighter to her sides so the smell of anxious couldn&rsquo;t escape from her armpits.&ldquo;Busy this morning.&rdquo; Malcolm's voice sounded so calm and easy. How could he be so comfortable when she couldn&rsquo;t remember how to stand like a person. And he smelled so good. Just a simple clean soap smell with maybe a touch of wood, like sawdust. His smell this close to her made her tongue feel dry. How was that fair.Kaitlin felt the words &ldquo;Yeah, right?&rdquo; croak from her throat as she looked up at his face. Malcolm's bright half smile, the deep brown of his cheeks, and those gorgeous almost black almond eyes. Not. Fair. At. All. The line shuffled forward again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you- we- could, you know, finally make it out- get together.&rdquo; Malcolm sounded a little less smooth just then. Kaitlin could feel her heart slow to a manageable rhythm. At least some part of him might be close to her level. Stumbling over a few words didn&rsquo;t stop him from being so damned pretty though. He added &ldquo;I mean Medicine is demanding, right? Like timewise and workwise.&rdquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only first year, but yeah I guess so. Engineering can&rsquo;t be so super easy either.&rdquo; Kaitlin could feel her cheeks warming. She just hoped against hope that she didn&rsquo;t look like a frickin tomato. This was the longest she had ever talked to Malcolm without the buffer of a group of mutual friends. Maggie had told her that she heard from Lane &ldquo;that if Kaitlin asked Malcolm to go for coffee, that he would for sure say yes&rdquo;. It was all very junior high, but it still sent Kaitlin&rsquo;s stomach into backflips. Then she had gone up and asked him at Janice and Dean&rsquo;s house party, well her and two beers had gone up and asked him. She felt floaty and &nbsp;hadn&rsquo;t been sure that it was real, but here they were, saturday morning, standing in line for coffee. Together. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in civil, so I spent the last couple months reading about asphalt. Mostly we just memorize equations and play a lot of basketball&rdquo; He said, laughing it off and looking up to the menu board. &ldquo;Same. Well, except it&rsquo;s anatomy and tennis for me.&rdquo;&ldquo;Tennis? I tried badminton, but I never played tennis before.&rdquo;&ldquo;We should!&rdquo; Kaitlin felt her voice jump in volume and she wrestled it back down. &ldquo;I mean, if you wanted to try it out sometime, I could- I would be happy to teach you&rdquo; Kaitlin fought off images of long brown legs and short white shorts. She closed the invitation with a weak grin.&ldquo;Maybe for a second, or third date?&rdquo; Malcolm had replaced that half smile with a sly sideways glance.If she didn&rsquo;t look like a tomato before, there was no way she didn&rsquo;t now. That heat had spread from her cheeks to the tips of her ears. The line shuffled forward and they found themselves in front of the counter. Together. Captain V-neck barely focused on them, wiped his hands across his &lsquo;Burks&rsquo; apron, and tossed off a bored &ldquo;So what&rsquo;ll you have?&rdquo;Kaitlin was devoting an unreasonable amount of attention to the warm latte in her hands. She studied the tiny puckered pinholes in the lid. The the wisps of steam that drifted up and away into the crisp october air. None of it was interesting in the slightest, but she made a real effort to keep her eyes locked on that lid. People don&rsquo;t die of nervous embarrassment do they?They started talking about school, since that was easy neutral territory. They both asked the same simple, customary questions, and gave the same, simple, rote answers. It felt to Kaitlin like they were participating in a conversational ritual with no clear goal, but it was better than the alternative. She was mostly thinking about just sinking into the cracks of the concrete and disappearing entirely. She kept her mouth moving so by the time they had walked the two blocks from the coffee shop to the river path, Kaitlin could feel herself relaxing a bit.She started to realize how fast she had been walking and slowed enough to take in the orange and yellow crested trees. Malcolm slowed with her.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty down here.&rdquo; He said, stopping to regard a group of vibrant poplars.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice place to run. Lots of people, but it&rsquo;s not usually crowded.&rdquo; It had been weeks since Kaitlin had gone on a proper run, but she wasn&rsquo;t going to say that out loud. Besides, it wasn&rsquo;t a lie. She really did like this stretch of the river path. She looked up at Malcolm while he closed his eyes and took a deep breath of cool air. Maybe this was going okay. She hadn&rsquo;t felt like a complete disaster in at least four minutes. He had laughed at her jokes. That had to be a good sign.&ldquo;You live close, right? Maggie said you live on this side of town.&rdquo;Kaitlin was startled and felt her eyes involuntarily snap skyward. Had she been staring? Maybe. Did Malcolm catch her staring? Maybe. &ldquo;Uh&rdquo; Kaitlin uttered. Seemed an easy enough question, but it took a second for her brain to change gears and process it. &ldquo;Um. Yeah. Yeah. We live just over there. Like three blocks from Burks.&rdquo;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s convenient, for running I mean. I live way east. Past the university. It&rsquo;s all just copies of the same couple of houses. Nicest place over there is the parks between the &lsquo;burbs.&rdquo; He smiled as Kaitlin walked her eyes back over to his. She could feel herself smiling back and only a little warm in the cheeks this time.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know much of the city. I just moved here for school.&rdquo; Kaitlin trailed off. She felt like there was nothing interesting she could add after that, and her smile faded. The last thing she wanted to do was bore Malcolm with small town stories. Of course, he went and asked anyway, because that was the ritual, right?&ldquo;Oh yeah? Where are you from?&rdquo;They quickly drifted back into that same question/answer pattern, but more relaxed, maybe a bit more sincere. They strolled past dozens of mid morning joggers and cyclists trying to shake off a week of sitting on their butts. The air was warming as the sun slowly rose in the sky. When they came to a small bend in the river path Kaitlin stopped short to take in the view. Shafts of sunlight were streaming through the trees and tiny spikes of gold formed on the ripples in the river. &ldquo;That deserves a picture.&rdquo; Kaitlin breathed, and slid her phone from her pocket. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold your coffee&rdquo; Malcolm offered. She handed him the cup and took a couple quick shots. It seemed like maybe she was missing an opportunity here.&ldquo;Want one with us in it? I can send it to you.&rdquo; She asked&ldquo;Yeah. That&rsquo;s a good idea.&rdquo;Kaitlin stepped back off the path and felt the warmth of Malcolm sliding in behind her as he moved into frame. She was starting to hold it together. Only a tiny bit of her felt like sinking into the soil and blending in with the tree roots. He brought his face up beside hers and she tried to get both of them and the trees behind into one balanced photo. Click. She really didn&rsquo;t feel like moving though. This was nice, just like this. &ldquo;Here you go.&rdquo; Malcolm brought her cup up into view and she reached for it with her free hand. Her fingers wrapped over his and she looked up at her phone screen just in time to see Malcolm&rsquo;s beautiful eyes, now fully wide with surprise, slide out of view over her shoulder. She gripped hard as she felt his hand slipping away, both of them crushing the remnants of the latte into warm spray. She felt herself being pulled down by the hand, then the shoulder, then the ground dropped from underneath her. She was being yanked down, butt first, still clinging to Malcolm&rsquo;s hand. She opened her mouth in panic, but her voice was absent. Kaitlin&rsquo;s phone, still locked in selfie position, lit up in her hand. Her ringtone &ldquo;Yakety Sax&rdquo; barked out at her. She snapped up to sitting, her spine rigid. She had to detangle her other hand from something to mash at the face of the phone. Instinctively, she answered the call and slapped the phone to speaker mode.&ldquo;Hel-wha-Who? What is- Who is this?&rdquo;&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t move.&rdquo; A calm, businesslike voice. Female maybe? The voice echoed like whoever it was, they were speaking to Kaitlin through a culvert. &ldquo;What? Why? What?&rdquo; She felt immobilized from the tongue down. Kaitlin wasn&rsquo;t sure she could move even if she hadn&rsquo;t felt scared out of her mind.&ldquo;Sorry to interrupt. I&rsquo;m Gina and I was wondering if you might need some help.&rdquo;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Kaitlin screamed into the phone.&ldquo;Who is that? What-&rdquo; Malcolm screamed up at her. Or maybe he was screaming at the phone, it was hard to tell. Either way, she flinched when she noticed his face lying right beside her hip. For a second there, she had forgotten that he existed. No, that can&rsquo;t be right. Some hollow static from the phone cut her off mid thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry that I interrupted. I just wanted to know if you might need some assistance. Kaitlin Doyle and Malcolm Aldridge, is it?&rdquo; The voice on the phone pattered back at her. The sound of Kaitlin&rsquo;s name caught her attentions. That was something real she could latch onto. &ldquo; I just want you to stay put for a second while I access your accounts.&rdquo;&ldquo;What accounts?&rdquo; Malcolm spluttered.&ldquo;What accounts?&rdquo; Kaitlin parroted.&ldquo;If you could just hold on for one second, and again, please try not to move.&rdquo;There didn&rsquo;t seem to be anything Kaitlin could do at the moment. Gina, the voice on the phone was saying to stay put. Her legs were in total agreement, so they stayed frozen to the ground. Looking. She could probably look around? That didn&rsquo;t count as moving right?So she looked around. Aside from her phone screen there seemed to be a dim red orange light filling the cavern. Okay, cavern! That was a thing! This definitely looked like a cavern. A big one. What else, what else? Stone floor. Smooth stone floor. Tile? Nope. Bigger. Huge stone blocks, mostly smooth with cracks and imperfections. So stone that has worn smooth, not stone that has been machined smooth. Okay. Good, good. Malcolm! There he is. He doesn&rsquo;t look very calm. Rapid breathing, dilated pupils. Maybe a panic attack? He&rsquo;s not looking back at Kaitlin. He&rsquo;s looking straight ahead at something right behind her. What? She turns her head and glances over her shoulder. Nope.Not ready for that yet. What else, what else? Some dirt on the stone floor. Hmm, dirt? So probably not water. What wears stone smooth? Water. But if it were water the stone would be wet and there shouldn&rsquo;t be dirt. Okay, that&rsquo;s sorted. She should probably check again. She didn&rsquo;t really see what she saw, right?A nice slow turn of the head. Nothing flashy. Just a nice slow glance. Really take it all in. Yeah. Still there. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; Malcolm whispers the question, but Kaitlin understands every nuance of that one syllable. It&rsquo;s not just &ldquo;what am I looking at?&rdquo; - it is that, but not only that. It&rsquo;s what to everything. What is this place? What are we doing? What happened? What is happening? Kaitlin reached out to Malcolm&rsquo;s hand again. There is no infatuated fumbling. There is no heart stopping, electric moment of contact. She needs an anchor. She can tell by his &ldquo;What?&rdquo; that he needs one too. Her fingers mesh with his and she whispers back an answer.&ldquo;Yeah. It&rsquo;s a giant skeleton.&rdquo;She Turned her head to take it all in. She probably could have done just as well only moving her eyes, but the ridiculous enormity of the thing seemed to warrant some neck movement. It was maybe a block or so away from them. Were city blocks a useful metric in a cavern? Didn&rsquo;t matter. Kaitlin knew blocks and so blocks it was. The skeleton must have been 12 meters tall, with arms splayed out at least twice that wide. Oh, wait. It was only the top half of a giant skeleton. The bottom half disappeared down in some sort of hole. There was steam or gas belching from the hole, along with that red orange glow that filled the cavern. She figured it must be a volcanic vent or geyser, but something about it didn&rsquo;t seem entirely natural. The whole scene looked staged like an amusement park ride. Meaning what? The Skeleton was stuck? It was climbing out of the hole? Maybe it had fallen in. Maybe it had been put in. In any case, the part that was visible was only half of the thing. Amusement park. That notion came rushing back through Kaitlin&rsquo;s head. Why? Something wasn&rsquo;t right. Giant Skeletons are not normal, sure, but this tableau was really false. What was it? Skull, orbital bones, Zygomatic Process, mandible, C4-5-6-7, Clavicle, scapula, humerus. Human. It was a human skeleton, but on a massive scale. She could name and label every single bone. Nothing surprising there, aside from the size of the thing. It took a moment to click. The skeleton was moving. A slow gyrating dance that repeated every couple of seconds. Not really a threatening display, but unsettling in a metronomic sort of way. Here is the part that really gave Kaitlin the willies though. Every single one of the dozens of visible bones was absolutely crawling with human scale skeletons. The left humerus of the thing was composed of 6 - no - 8 regular human skeletons crawling, moving, and gyrating in their own unique rhythmic pattern. All of them gripping onto the hands or feet or ribcage of the skeleton next to them. The entire surface of every single bone writhed and undulated like liquid. Kaitlin looked at the ground for a while.&ldquo;Hello? Are you still there? I apologize for the delay. I had a little trouble pulling up your accounts. Seems that they are very new. Like &lsquo;today&rsquo; new. They are still being filled in. What are you two doing?&rdquo; The phone signal had cleared up significantly , but Gina sounded confused. Kaitlin figured there was more than enough confusion on her own end of the phone and she didn&rsquo;t really need to be getting more of it from elsewhere.&ldquo;Well. I think maybe I&rsquo;m looking at a giant skeleton. Like three stories tall. Might be made of smaller skeletons. A lot of them. Other than that, not much. You?&rdquo; Kaitlin placed her own tone at somewhere between caustic and simmering rage. &ldquo;Yeah. Sorry about that. You&rsquo;re really not supposed to be there.&rdquo;&ldquo;Ya think!&rdquo; Malcolm Bellowed. He snapped up to standing, completely neglecting to let go of Kaitlin&rsquo;s hand first. With one hand in Malcolm&rsquo;s and the other gripping her phone that left no hands to stop her from toppling forward and bouncing off the stone floor. It might have been worn smooth, but it was still stone, and it still hurt.&ldquo;Ow! What the hell?&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh my god. I&rsquo;m so sorry. Are you okay?&rdquo; Malcolm stooped back down to help Kaitlin to her feet. She could see the genuine concern in those dark eyes, but even that wasn&rsquo;t enough to thoroughly drain her of confused, directionless, anger. She had some left to vent, so she scowled back at him as convincingly as she could. Everything she wanted from today was slipping away from her. She wasn&rsquo;t even sure what it was that she wanted, but falling into a cave populated by a massive skeleton creature wasn&rsquo;t part of it. She was pretty certain of that. Kaitlin took a second to brush the dust off her jeans, her new pullover, and attempt to organise her tangle of red-brown hair into something bordering on presentable. She noted that both she and Malcolm kept their feet rooted to the spot. Not even a tiny shuffle. They both kept a portion of their attention on the skeleton. Gina chimed in from wherever she was calling from. &ldquo;Is everything okay? You didn&rsquo;t move anywhere did you?&rdquo;&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Kaitlin and Malcolm fired back simultaneously. &ldquo;Good. Good. This guy has decent range, but terrible awareness. Still, if you get much closer you&rsquo;ll pull aggro for sure.&rdquo; Gina spoke in a halfhearted singsong like everything she was saying was completely obvious.&ldquo;Wait. What? Did you say pull aggro? What do you mean, pull aggro?&rdquo; Kaitlin responded and tossed a sheepish look at Malcolm.&ldquo;You know what she&rsquo;s talking about?&rdquo; &ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; Kaitlin sucked the breath in through her teeth and winced slightly. &ldquo;In my second year of pre-med, I almost lost a semester playing this game. An MMO. It was the only game I could get to run on my laptop. I played it with a bunch of friends, and you wander around this fantasy world and, you know, fight monsters.&rdquo; Kaitlin pointed gingerly toward the hulking heap of gyrating bones in the distance, &ldquo;Like this guy.&rdquo; &ldquo;My brother and I only ever had consoles&rdquo; Malcolm gaped at the skeleton, fully taking it in for the first time. He raised his voice slightly, speaking mostly to Gina over the phone. &ldquo;So are you saying that this is some sort of game? Are we in a game right now?&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh. No. No this isn&rsquo;t a game. This is real. I suppose you could say this is the source material.&rdquo; They could hear the frustration in Gina&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;So you two really should have gone through the tutorials. I just work on the help line. You know, like &lsquo;tips and tricks&rsquo; that sort of thing. You are both way underleveled for this encounter, and you are both specced as support classes. I don&rsquo;t even know how you got partied up without a fighter or ranged class. Why were you together at the gate anyway?&rdquo;&ldquo;Umm,&rdquo; Kaitlin found herself turning to look into Malcolm&rsquo;s eyes as she spoke. She didn&rsquo;t know if she needed confirmation or confidence or just an ally. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re, um, we were on a date?&rdquo;To Kaitlin&rsquo;s relief Malcolm nodded and returned her gaze. &ldquo;Yeah. Yeah, a date.&rdquo;&ldquo;WHAT?!? Well no wonder you&rsquo;re in here!&rdquo; The sudden volume of Gina&rsquo;s voice snapped them both out their reverie. &ldquo;This was my first call of the day, and you&rsquo;re both on a date with a party member! This is why people are supposed to go through the tutorial! I have to submit a ticket to admissions now, but I can&rsquo;t because I have to get you two out of this encounter first. Okay. Okay. Let&rsquo;s just all calm down.&rdquo;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re calm. I think? Are we calm?&rdquo; Kaitlin replied, doing her best impression of a calm person while keeping one eye on the colossal pile of wriggling bones.&ldquo;Sure. Yep, we can be calm. Placid even.&rdquo; Malcolm chorused in. &ldquo;Hmm, okay.&rdquo; They could hear the sound of drink sipping and glasses being placed on a desktop over the phone. &ldquo;Okay. We can do this. Alright. Lets see. That big guy over there is Gashadokuro. Like I said before, his perception is very poor but his attack range covers most of the cave. He shouldn&rsquo;t be able to climb out of that hole, so I don&rsquo;t think you have to worry about him chasing you. Let me pull up the drawings of the encounter space.&rdquo;Malcolm looked quizzical and asked &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a Gash -a duke, doke, toka. What?&rdquo;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a japanese version of the bone golem, or giant skeleton. There are 15 or 16 of them around the world. We have Gashadokuro here on an exchange from Arashiyama. They have the Wendigo there for the rest of the year. We&rsquo;ve run exchange programs since the 50&rsquo;s, but this is one of the biggest construction sites. His whole cave was moved stone by stone. It&rsquo;s really quite impressive. Okay. I have a path for you. So, do you want the good news or the bad news?&rdquo;Kaitlin eyed Malcolm. He took in a deep breath and blinked heavily like he was trying to shake off a dizzy spell. She could feel herself doing the same.&ldquo;Good?&rdquo; Kaitlin asked with dread.&ldquo;There is a path most of the way around that skirts his projected zone of perception. You just have to hug the left wall of the cavern when you exit the entrance area, and don&rsquo;t move more than about a meter and a half from the wall all the way around. So hug the wall and you should be able to reach the exit without fighting.&rdquo;There was a short silence before Malcolm asked &ldquo;And the bad news?&rdquo;&ldquo;You have to move slow, like nothing faster than a leisurely walk, so the path to the exit will take around two hours. Also, there is a spot at the end where the rock juts out. There is no way that he doesn&rsquo;t see you when you reach that point. It&rsquo;s also within his attack range and neither of you has earned a weapon or any defensive equipment. So, okay, are you ready for this?&rdquo; Gina didn&rsquo;t wait to find out if they were ready. &ldquo;When you hit that spot, you are going to have to run. Like I mean run. You will have to flat out sprint to the exit. But good news again, the exit is only about one hundred seventy meters from there. So the path is this; slow, slow, slow, book it. Sound doable?&rdquo;&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we just go back the way we came in?&rdquo; Malcolm said.&ldquo;Nope. That path is closed, besides it&rsquo;s straight up and no one is carrying any climbing gear. Through the cave is really the only route. I can talk you through it.&rdquo;Kaitlin gulped back a breath. &ldquo;Oh. No. Oh no. I didn&rsquo;t plug in my phone.&rdquo;Malcolm looked confused and rubbed his knuckles along his temple. &ldquo;What. Okay. Why? Why does that matter.&rdquo; Half a beat later. &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh, okay.&rdquo; Gina chimed in with a practiced reassurance that only slightly sounded false. &ldquo;How long do you have left?&rdquo;Kaitlin pictured last night vividly, listening to music on her phone while she reviewed the muscles of the forearm. She remembered lifter her head from the book sometime later, shutting off the music, and dragging herself off to bed. Nowhere in that memory did she plug in her phone. &ldquo;10%.&rdquo;&ldquo;Well that won&rsquo;t last two hours. You&rsquo;ll just have to listen carefully, and I&rsquo;ll talk to you again when you reach the other end.&rdquo;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\twe're still not at the end. Might be a couple more entries. Let me know if this 'a little at a time' writing schedule is too jarring. I could imagine that most people would like to just read the whole thing in one go when it is all done (which is why I put these little blurbs at the top. So you know what weeks to skip if you are waiting for the end), but I also thought it might be an interesting document of the process. Each week, I change a little more of the previous entries. Not sure if that is the best way of working, but what the hell, it's a lot better than thinking about writing stories and not doing it.The line shuffled forward a few steps and Kaitlin shuffled with them. She was fairly sure that she had forgotten how her knees worked. Was she being awkward? Maybe? Oh god, she was. She absolutely was being the most awkward. All she had to do was walk a few steps and not act like a doofus. Hundreds of times, many hundreds of times, she had stood in this same line in front of this same counter in this same coffee shop waiting for the same low V-neck wearing barista taking his slow ass time. Sometimes she felt tired or irritable, sometimes she felt rushed and overextended, but never awkward. Now she was feeling judgemental and guilty for feeling judgemental. Or maybe she just felt anxious. Did it show? Could Malcolm tell? He totally could. How could he not? Anxious was leaking out of her pores. She pressed her arms a little tighter to her sides so the smell of anxious couldn&rsquo;t escape from her armpits.&ldquo;Busy this morning.&rdquo; Malcolm's voice sounded so calm and easy. How could he be so comfortable when she couldn&rsquo;t remember how to stand like a person. And he smelled so good. Just a simple clean soap smell with maybe a touch of wood, like sawdust. His smell this close to her made her tongue feel dry. How was that fair.Kaitlin felt the words &ldquo;Yeah, right?&rdquo; croak from her throat as she looked up at his face. Malcolm's bright half smile, the deep brown of his cheeks, and those gorgeous almost black almond eyes. Not. Fair. At. All. The line shuffled forward again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you- we- could, you know, finally make it out- get together.&rdquo; Malcolm sounded a little less smooth just then. Kaitlin could feel her heart slow to a manageable rhythm. At least some part of him might be close to her level. Stumbling over a few words didn&rsquo;t stop him from being so damned pretty though. He added &ldquo;I mean Medicine is demanding, right? Like timewise and workwise.&rdquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only first year, but yeah I guess so. Engineering can&rsquo;t be so super easy either.&rdquo; Kaitlin could feel her cheeks warming. She just hoped against hope that she didn&rsquo;t look like a frickin tomato. This was the longest she had ever talked to Malcolm without the buffer of a group of mutual friends. Maggie had told her that she heard from Lane &ldquo;that if Kaitlin asked Malcolm to go for coffee, that he would for sure say yes&rdquo;. It was all very junior high, but it still sent Kaitlin&rsquo;s stomach into backflips. Then she had gone up and asked him at Janice and Dean&rsquo;s house party, well her and two beers had gone up and asked him. She felt floaty and &nbsp;hadn&rsquo;t been sure that it was real, but here they were, saturday morning, standing in line for coffee. Together. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in civil, so I spent the last couple months reading about asphalt. Mostly we just memorize equations and play a lot of basketball&rdquo; He said, laughing it off and looking up to the menu board. &ldquo;Same. Well, except it&rsquo;s anatomy and tennis for me.&rdquo;&ldquo;Tennis? I tried badminton, but I never played tennis before.&rdquo;&ldquo;We should!&rdquo; Kaitlin felt her voice jump in volume and she wrestled it back down. &ldquo;I mean, if you wanted to try it out sometime, I could- I would be happy to teach you&rdquo; Kaitlin fought off images of long brown legs and short white shorts. She closed the invitation with a weak grin.&ldquo;Maybe for a second, or third date?&rdquo; Malcolm had replaced that half smile with a sly sideways glance.If she didn&rsquo;t look like a tomato before, there was no way she didn&rsquo;t now. That heat had spread from her cheeks to the tips of her ears. The line shuffled forward and they found themselves in front of the counter. Together. Captain V-neck barely focused on them, wiped his hands across his &lsquo;Burks&rsquo; apron, and tossed off a bored &ldquo;So what&rsquo;ll you have?&rdquo;Kaitlin was devoting an unreasonable amount of attention to the warm latte in her hands. She studied the tiny puckered pinholes in the lid. The the wisps of steam that drifted up and away into the crisp october air. None of it was interesting in the slightest, but she made a real effort to keep her eyes locked on that lid. People don&rsquo;t die of nervous embarrassment do they?They started talking about school, since that was easy neutral territory. They both asked the same simple, customary questions, and gave the same, simple, rote answers. It felt to Kaitlin like they were participating in a conversational ritual with no clear goal, but it was better than the alternative. She was mostly thinking about just sinking into the cracks of the concrete and disappearing entirely. She kept her mouth moving so by the time they had walked the two blocks from the coffee shop to the river path, Kaitlin could feel herself relaxing a bit.She started to realize how fast she had been walking and slowed enough to take in the orange and yellow crested trees. Malcolm slowed with her.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty down here.&rdquo; He said, stopping to regard a group of vibrant poplars.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice place to run. Lots of people, but it&rsquo;s not usually crowded.&rdquo; It had been weeks since Kaitlin had gone on a proper run, but she wasn&rsquo;t going to say that out loud. Besides, it wasn&rsquo;t a lie. She really did like this stretch of the river path. She looked up at Malcolm while he closed his eyes and took a deep breath of cool air. Maybe this was going okay. She hadn&rsquo;t felt like a complete disaster in at least four minutes. He had laughed at her jokes. That had to be a good sign.&ldquo;You live close, right? Maggie said you live on this side of town.&rdquo;Kaitlin was startled and felt her eyes involuntarily snap skyward. Had she been staring? Maybe. Did Malcolm catch her staring? Maybe. &ldquo;Uh&rdquo; Kaitlin uttered. Seemed an easy enough question, but it took a second for her brain to change gears and process it. &ldquo;Um. Yeah. Yeah. We live just over there. Like three blocks from Burks.&rdquo;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s convenient, for running I mean. I live way east. Past the university. It&rsquo;s all just copies of the same couple of houses. Nicest place over there is the parks between the &lsquo;burbs.&rdquo; He smiled as Kaitlin walked her eyes back over to his. She could feel herself smiling back and only a little warm in the cheeks this time.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know much of the city. I just moved here for school.&rdquo; Kaitlin trailed off. She felt like there was nothing interesting she could add after that, and her smile faded. The last thing she wanted to do was bore Malcolm with small town stories. Of course, he went and asked anyway, because that was the ritual, right?&ldquo;Oh yeah? Where are you from?&rdquo;They quickly drifted back into that same question/answer pattern, but more relaxed, maybe a bit more sincere. They strolled past dozens of mid morning joggers and cyclists trying to shake off a week of sitting on their butts. The air was warming as the sun slowly rose in the sky. When they came to a small bend in the river path Kaitlin stopped short to take in the view. Shafts of sunlight were streaming through the trees and tiny spikes of gold formed on the ripples in the river. &ldquo;That deserves a picture.&rdquo; Kaitlin breathed, and slid her phone from her pocket. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold your coffee&rdquo; Malcolm offered. She handed him the cup and took a couple quick shots. It seemed like maybe she was missing an opportunity here.&ldquo;Want one with us in it? I can send it to you.&rdquo; She asked&ldquo;Yeah. That&rsquo;s a good idea.&rdquo;Kaitlin stepped back off the path and felt the warmth of Malcolm sliding in behind her as he moved into frame. She was starting to hold it together. Only a tiny bit of her felt like sinking into the soil and blending in with the tree roots. He brought his face up beside hers and she tried to get both of them and the trees behind into one balanced photo. Click. She really didn&rsquo;t feel like moving though. This was nice, just like this. &ldquo;Here you go.&rdquo; Malcolm brought her cup up into view and she reached for it with her free hand. Her fingers wrapped over his and she looked up at her phone screen just in time to see Malcolm&rsquo;s beautiful eyes, now fully wide with surprise, slide out of view over her shoulder. She gripped hard as she felt his hand slipping away, both of them crushing the remnants of the latte into warm spray. She felt herself being pulled down by the hand, then the shoulder, then the ground dropped from underneath her. She was being yanked down, butt first, still clinging to Malcolm&rsquo;s hand. She opened her mouth in panic, but her voice was absent. Kaitlin&rsquo;s phone, still locked in selfie position, lit up in her hand. Her ringtone &ldquo;Yakety Sax&rdquo; barked out at her. She snapped up to sitting, her spine rigid. She had to detangle her other hand from something to mash at the face of the phone. Instinctively, she answered the call and slapped the phone to speaker mode.&ldquo;Hel-wha-Who? What is- Who is this?&rdquo;&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t move.&rdquo; A calm, businesslike voice. Female maybe? The voice echoed like whoever it was, they were speaking to Kaitlin through a culvert. &ldquo;What? Why? What?&rdquo; She felt immobilized from the tongue down. Kaitlin wasn&rsquo;t sure she could move even if she hadn&rsquo;t felt scared out of her mind.&ldquo;Sorry to interrupt. I&rsquo;m Gina and I was wondering if you might need some help.&rdquo;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Kaitlin screamed into the phone.&ldquo;Who is that? What-&rdquo; Malcolm screamed up at her. Or maybe he was screaming at the phone, it was hard to tell. Either way, she flinched when she noticed his face lying right beside her hip. For a second there, she had forgotten that he existed. No, that can&rsquo;t be right. Some hollow static from the phone cut her off mid thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry that I interrupted. I just wanted to know if you might need some assistance. Kaitlin Doyle and Malcolm Aldridge, is it?&rdquo; The voice on the phone pattered back at her. The sound of Kaitlin&rsquo;s name caught her attentions. That was something real she could latch onto. &ldquo; I just want you to stay put for a second while I access your accounts.&rdquo;&ldquo;What accounts?&rdquo; Malcolm spluttered.&ldquo;What accounts?&rdquo; Kaitlin parroted.&ldquo;If you could just hold on for one second, and again, please try not to move.&rdquo;There didn&rsquo;t seem to be anything Kaitlin could do at the moment. Gina, the voice on the phone was saying to stay put. Her legs were in total agreement, so they stayed frozen to the ground. Looking. She could probably look around? That didn&rsquo;t count as moving right?So she looked around. Aside from her phone screen there seemed to be a dim red orange light filling the cavern. Okay, cavern! That was a thing! This definitely looked like a cavern. A big one. What else, what else? Stone floor. Smooth stone floor. Tile? Nope. Bigger. Huge stone blocks, mostly smooth with cracks and imperfections. So stone that has worn smooth, not stone that has been machined smooth. Okay. Good, good. Malcolm! There he is. He doesn&rsquo;t look very calm. Rapid breathing, dilated pupils. Maybe a panic attack? He&rsquo;s not looking back at Kaitlin. He&rsquo;s looking straight ahead at something right behind her. What? She turns her head and glances over her shoulder. Nope.Not ready for that yet. What else, what else? Some dirt on the stone floor. Hmm, dirt? So probably not water. What wears stone smooth? Water. But if it were water the stone would be wet and there shouldn&rsquo;t be dirt. Okay, that&rsquo;s sorted. She should probably check again. She didn&rsquo;t really see what she saw, right?A nice slow turn of the head. Nothing flashy. Just a nice slow glance. Really take it all in. Yeah. Still there. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; Malcolm whispers the question, but Kaitlin understands every nuance of that one syllable. It&rsquo;s not just &ldquo;what am I looking at?&rdquo; - it is that, but not only that. It&rsquo;s what to everything. What is this place? What are we doing? What happened? What is happening? Kaitlin reached out to Malcolm&rsquo;s hand again. There is no infatuated fumbling. There is no heart stopping, electric moment of contact. She needs an anchor. She can tell by his &ldquo;What?&rdquo; that he needs one too. Her fingers mesh with his and she whispers back an answer.&ldquo;Yeah. It&rsquo;s a giant skeleton.&rdquo;She Turned her head to take it all in. She probably could have done just as well only moving her eyes, but the ridiculous enormity of the thing seemed to warrant some neck movement. It was maybe a block or so away from them. Were city blocks a useful metric in a cavern? Didn&rsquo;t matter. Kaitlin knew blocks and so blocks it was. The skeleton must have been 12 meters tall, with arms splayed out at least twice that wide. Oh, wait. It was only the top half of a giant skeleton. The bottom half disappeared down in some sort of hole. There was steam or gas belching from the hole, along with that red orange glow that filled the cavern. She figured it must be a volcanic vent or geyser, but something about it didn&rsquo;t seem entirely natural. The whole scene looked staged like an amusement park ride. Meaning what? The Skeleton was stuck? It was climbing out of the hole? Maybe it had fallen in. Maybe it had been put in. In any case, the part that was visible was only half of the thing. Amusement park. That notion came rushing back through Kaitlin&rsquo;s head. Why? Something wasn&rsquo;t right. Giant Skeletons are not normal, sure, but this tableau was really false. What was it? Skull, orbital bones, Zygomatic Process, mandible, C4-5-6-7, Clavicle, scapula, humerus. Human. It was a human skeleton, but on a massive scale. She new every single bone. Nothing surprising there, aside from the size of the thing. It took a moment to click. The skeleton was moving. A slow gyrating dance that repeated every couple of seconds. Not really a threatening display, but unsettling in a metronomic rhythm sort of way. Here is the part that really gave Kaitlin the willies though. Every single one of the dozens of visible bones was absolutely crawling with human scale skeletons. The left humerus of the thing was composed of 6 - no - 8 regular human skeletons crawling, moving, and gyrating in their own unique rhythmic pattern. All of them gripping onto the hands or feet or ribcage of the skeleton next to them. The entire surface of every single bone writhed and undulated like liquid. Kaitlin looked at the ground for a while.&ldquo;Hello? Are you still there? I apologize for the delay. I had a little trouble pulling up your accounts. Seems that they are very new. Like &lsquo;today&rsquo; new. They are still being filled in. What are you two doing?&rdquo; Gina sounded confused. Kaitlin figured there was more than enough confusion on her own end of the phone and she didn&rsquo;t really need to be getting more of it from elsewhere.&ldquo;Well. I think maybe I&rsquo;m looking at a giant skeleton. Like three stories tall. Might be made of smaller skeletons. A lot of them. Other than that, not much. You?&rdquo; Kaitlin placed her own tone at somewhere between caustic and simmering rage. &ldquo;Yeah. Sorry about that. You&rsquo;re really not supposed to be there.&rdquo;&ldquo;Ya think!&rdquo; Malcolm Bellowed. He snapped up to standing, completely neglecting to let go of Kaitlin&rsquo;s hand first. With one hand in Malcolm&rsquo;s and the other gripping her phone that left no hands to stop her from toppling forward and bouncing off the stone floor. It might have been worn smooth, but it was still stone, and it still hurt.&ldquo;Ow! What the hell?&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh my god. I&rsquo;m so sorry. Are you okay?&rdquo; Malcolm stooped back down to help Kaitlin to her feet. She could see the genuine concern in those dark eyes, but even that wasn&rsquo;t enough to thoroughly drain her of confused, directionless, anger. She had some left to vent, so she scowled back at him as convincingly as she could. Everything she wanted from today was slipping away from her. She wasn&rsquo;t even sure what it was that she wanted, but falling into a cave populated by a massive skeleton creature wasn&rsquo;t part of it. She knew that much. Kaitlin took a second to brush the dust off her jeans, her new pullover, and attempt to organise her tangle of red-brown hair into something bordering on presentable. She noted that both she and Malcolm kept their feet rooted to the spot. Not even a tiny shuffle. They both kept a portion of their attention on the skeleton. Gina chimed in from wherever she was calling from. &ldquo;Is everything okay? You didn&rsquo;t move anywhere did you?&rdquo;&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Kaitlin and Malcolm fired back simultaneously. \t\t"

I could just stop mid sentence, but that doesn't seem very reader friendly.&nbsp; So probably 2 more posts, maybe 3 before the conclusion?The line shuffled forward a few steps and Kaitlin shuffled with them. She was fairly sure that she had forgotten how her knees worked. Was she being awkward? Maybe? Oh god, she was. She absolutely was being the most awkward. All she had to do was walk a few steps and not act like a doofus. Hundreds of times, many hundreds of times, she had stood in this same line in front of this same counter in this same coffee shop waiting for the same low V-neck wearing barista taking his slow ass time.

Engineering can&rsquo;t be so super easy either.&rdquo; Kaitlin could feel her cheeks warming. She just hoped against hope that she didn&rsquo;t look like a frickin tomato. This was the longest she had ever talked to Malcolm without the buffer of a group of mutual friends. Maggie had told her that she heard from Lane &ldquo;that if Kaitlin asked Malcolm to go for coffee, that he would for sure say yes&rdquo;. It was all very junior high, but it still sent Kaitlin&rsquo;s stomach into backflips. Then she had gone up and asked him at Janice and Dean&rsquo;s house party, well her and two beers had gone up and asked him. She felt floaty and &nbsp;hadn&rsquo;t been sure that it was real, but here they were, saturday morning, standing in line for coffee. Together. &ldquo;We only have to memorize a few equations.

They both asked the same simple, customary questions, and gave the same, simple, rote answers.

Sometimes she felt tired or irritable, sometimes she felt rushed and overextended, but never awkward. Now she was feeling judgemental and guilty for feeling judgemental. Or maybe she just felt anxious. Did it show? Could Malcolm tell? He totally could. How could he not? Anxious was leaking out of her pores. She pressed her arms a little tighter to her sides so the smell of anxious couldn&rsquo;t escape from her armpits.&ldquo;Busy this morning.&rdquo; Malcolm's voice sounded so calm and easy. How could he be so comfortable when she couldn&rsquo;t remember how to stand like a person. And he smelled so good. Just a simple clean soap smell with maybe a touch of wood, like sawdust. His smell this close to her made her tongue feel dry. How was that fair.Kaitlin felt the words &ldquo;Yeah, right?&rdquo; croak from her throat as she looked up at his face. Malcolm's bright half smile, the deep brown of his cheeks, and those gorgeous almost black almond eyes. Not. Fair. At. All. The line shuffled forward again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you- we- could, you know, finally make it out- get together.&rdquo; Malcolm sounded a little less smooth just then. Kaitlin could feel her heart slow to a manageable rhythm. At least some part of him might be close to her level. Stumbling over a few words didn&rsquo;t stop him from being so damned pretty though. He added &ldquo;I mean Medicine is pretty demanding, right? Like timewise and workwise.&rdquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only first year, but yeah I guess so. Engineering can&rsquo;t be so super easy either.&rdquo; Kaitlin could feel her cheeks warming. She just hoped against hope that she didn&rsquo;t look like a frickin tomato. This was the longest she had ever talked to Malcolm without the buffer of a group of mutual friends. Maggie had told her that she heard from Lane &ldquo;that if Kaitlin asked Malcolm to go for coffee, that he would for sure say yes&rdquo;. It was all very junior high, but it still sent Kaitlin&rsquo;s stomach into backflips. Then she had gone up and asked him at Janice and Dean&rsquo;s house party, well her and two beers had gone up and asked him. She felt floaty and &nbsp;hadn&rsquo;t been sure that it was real, but here they were, saturday morning, standing in line for coffee. Together. &ldquo;We only have to memorize a few equations. Mostly we just play a lot of basketball&rdquo; He said, laughing it off and looking up to the menu board. &ldquo;Same. Well, except it&rsquo;s anatomy and tennis for me.&rdquo;&ldquo;Tennis? I tried badminton, but I never played tennis before.&rdquo;&ldquo;We should!&rdquo; Kaitlin felt her voice jump in volume and she wrestled it back down. &ldquo;I mean, if you wanted to try it out sometime, I could- I would be happy to teach you&rdquo; Kaitlin fought off images of long brown legs and short white shorts long enough to close with a weak grin.&ldquo;Maybe for a second, or third date?&rdquo; Malcolm had replaced that half smile with a sly sideways glance.If she didn&rsquo;t look like a tomato before, there was no way she didn&rsquo;t now. That heat had spread from her cheeks to the tips of her ears. The line shuffled forward and they found themselves in front of the counter. Together. Captain V-neck barely focused on them, wiped his hands across his &lsquo;Burks&rsquo; apron, and tossed off a bored &ldquo;So what&rsquo;ll you have?&rdquo;Kaitlin spent all of her attention on the warm latte in her hands. She studied the tiny puckered pinholes in the lid. The the wisps of steam that drifted up and away into the crisp october air. None of it was interesting in the slightest, but she made a real effort to keep her eyes locked on that lid. People don&rsquo;t die of nervous embarrassment do they?They started talking about school, since that was easy neutral territory. They both asked the same simple, customary questions, and gave the same, simple, rote answers. It felt to Kaitlin like they were participating in a conversational ritual with no clear goal, but it was better than the alternative of sinking into the cracks of the concrete and disappearing entirely. Had she not kept her mouth moving, she was certain that is what the rest of her body had planned for her. By the time they had walked the two blocks from the coffee shop to the river path, Kaitlin could feel herself relaxing a bit.She started to realize how fast she had been walking and slowed enough to take in the orange and yellow crested trees. Malcolm slowed with her.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty down here.&rdquo; He said, stopping to regard a group of vibrant poplars.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice place to run. Lots of people, but it&rsquo;s not usually crowded.&rdquo; It had been weeks since Kaitlin had gone on a proper run, but she wasn&rsquo;t going to say that out loud. Besides, it wasn&rsquo;t really a lie. She really did like this stretch of the river path. She looked up at Malcolm while he closed his eyes and took a deep breath of cool air. Maybe this was going okay. She hadn&rsquo;t felt like a complete disaster in at least four minutes. That had to be a good sign.&ldquo;You live close, right? Maggie said you live on this side of town.&rdquo;Kaitlin was startled and felt her eyes involuntarily snap skyward. Had she been staring? Maybe. Did Malcolm catch her staring? Maybe. &ldquo;Uh&rdquo; Kaitlin uttered. Seemed an easy enough question, but it took a second for her brain to change gears and process it. &ldquo;Um. Yeah. Yeah. We live just over there. Like three blocks from Burks.&rdquo;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s convenient, for running I mean. I live way east. Past the university. Nicest place over there is just parks in the &lsquo;burbs.&rdquo; He smiled as Kaitlin walked her eyes back over to his. She could feel herself smiling back and only a little warm in the cheeks this time.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know much of the city. I just moved here for school.&rdquo; Kaitlin trailed off. She felt like there was nothing interesting she could add after that, and her smile faded. The last thing she wanted to do was bore Malcolm with small town stories. Of course, he went and asked anyway, because that was the ritual, right?&ldquo;Oh yeah? Where are you from?&rdquo;They quickly drifted back into that same question/answer pattern, but more relaxed, maybe a bit more sincere.They strolled past dozens of mid morning joggers and cyclists trying to shake off a weeks worth of sitting on their butts. The air was warming as the sun slowly rose in the sky. When they came to a small bend in the river path Kaitlin stopped short to take in the view. Shafts of sun were streaming through the trees and tiny golden pyramids formed on the ripples in the river.&ldquo;That deserves a picture.&rdquo; Kaitlin breathed, and slid her phone from her pocket. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold your coffee&rdquo; Malcolm offered. She handed him the cup and took a couple quick shots. It seemed like maybe she was missing an opportunity here.&ldquo;Want one with us in it?&rdquo; She asked&ldquo;Yeah, we could do that.&rdquo;Kaitlin stepped back off the path and felt the warmth of Malcolm stepping in behind her to get into frame. She was starting to hold it together in a bit more of a dignified fashion. She only half felt like sinking into the soil around her and blending in with the tree roots. He brought his face up beside hers and she tried to get both of them and the trees behind into one balanced photo. Click. She really didn&rsquo;t feel like moving though. This was nice, just like this. &ldquo;Here you go.&rdquo; Malcolm brought her cup up into view and she reached for it with her free hand. Her fingers wrapped over his and she looked up at her phone screen just in time to see Malcolm&rsquo;s beautiful eyes, now fully wide with surprise, slide out of view over her shoulder. She gripped hard as she felt his hand slipping away, both of them crushing the remnants of the latte into warm spray. She felt herself being pulled down by the hand, then the shoulder, then her entire body flipped backwards. She was being yanked down, butt first, into a hole far deeper than the riverbank had any right to be.\t\t"

If you have any comments or feedback, let me know and I'll try to edit accordingly.The line shuffled forward a few steps and Kaitlin shuffled with them. She felt like she might have forgotten how her knees worked. Was she being awkward? Maybe? Oh god, she was. She absolutely was being the most awkward.

    "content": "\t\t\t\t&#8203;My past post was the game that I made for the Ludum Dare game jam. It was a text based game using the interactive fiction engine Twine. Twine started out as a modification of the HTML and JavaScript modifiable web page thingy tiddlywiki http://tiddlywiki.com .Mostly, what you can make with it are really specialized web pages. It's all click this link to go here and click here to go back. This leads most people, rightly, to use it for creating choose your own adventure style stories and games. Ever since I learned about Twine, I wondered if maybe it could be used in a slightly different way. Choose your own adventure books can be done on paper and they aren't significantly improved by being on a computer. The fighting fantasy series of gamebooks Incorporated information tracking and random events, but both of those can be handles with a pencil and paper, and a couple of dice. If I was going to use Twine on a computer to make a game meant to be played on a computer, I wanted to make that meaningful. Using a computer gives you a couple of things. You can process a lot of information very quickly, and you can hide the it all from the player. That lets you create the sort of interactions you get in your pac-mans and your galagas. Fast, reactive experiences also known as video games.Using a game creation tool like Twine that is tailored toward slower, text based, or narrative games meant that fast was probably off the table. What I could do though was use the computer's ability to process information in a way that is mostly invisible to the player. The theme for the game jam was &ldquo;running out of power&rdquo; and I fairly quickly settled on the idea of a never ending chase where the only possible outcomes would be to die from exhaustion, or be caught and devoured. Fun stuff, but that is also the basic plot of Pac-Man and look at how well that turned out.Ever since zork, I had wanted to create a text adventure, but one that changed every time you played it. For that I went the easy route and just had the computer randomly select from lists of possible descriptions, this was something that was easy to implement, but not really a great solution since that adds more writing work, and it doesn't provide any meaningful difference to the choices you have to make. Game jams aren't really about great solutions, they are about making the thing go as best as you can as quickly as you can. To that end, the random approach did it's job. The other thing I wanted to add to the text adventure genre, was an ever changing environment. Each time you play it, it should be different. I didn't have time to come up with a better solution so I went for the random approach again. Only this time the game would select one of four maps and place you somewhere in the middle of it. The effect is disorienting and sort of annoying. That was by design and I was glad that it worked. For the maps, I started out planning them on a grid system. I was going to build all of the possible movement directions semi manually, but quickly realized that would take way too long. Then I started to build the maps in a sort of branching series of Twine nodes (passages) but that would require a lot of custom writing to say things like &ldquo;you can move left or right from here&rdquo;. Then I thought that maybe I could store the map in a series of arrays, since I had read that Twine could deal with arrays. After a few searches, I found that not only did Twine support arrays, it supported 2 dimensional arrays, which I did not expect, and someone else had already made a tutorial using them to create a navigation system very, very, much like the one I had thought up. So I partook of a time honoured programing tradition. I copied the code and modified it to work in my project. Now I could make maps on an x,y grid where certain cells would have custom descriptions while others would use the random descriptions for that particular map. The whole time you play, the game is keeping track of your exhaustion and how far away the devouring hoards from you. And that's it, you move up, navigating an unknowable maze and totally fail to avoid death. That's the whole game. It's not much but coming from knowing almost nothing about Twine to making something that will run perfectly over and over in 48hours is no small task. I'm happy with how it turned out.\t\t"

Just a bunch of wacky guys and girls.And a monkey.What?Throw in a monkey.Okay. Sure. A bunch of guys, girls, and a monkey and they are all assassins.Even the monkey?Especially the monkey, only he gets paid in bananas. So you get this whole group of assassins. Like, you got the boring action movie dude and the dangerous CEO spy lady -Yeah, and the paralyzed martial artist in a weaponized robot wheelchair.Really?Yeah. we already got a monkey. Get weird.Okay. How about the washed up film star that turns to crime for money?Not weird enough. Jack it right up.Maybe a bio-engineer that's built like a wrestler and has a robot hand?Getting there.How about ex conjoined twins that were separated by a train crash, and they are kids, but also assassins that fight holding hands. Now you got it. And they all get called by another guy&hellip;Who?Just some guy, like with a generic fake name.Like Mr. Acme?I like it. So Mr. Acme calls them all separately and hires them to kill each other.Why?Who cares. So they go to fight each other in all sorts of crazy places, like active weapons factory?How about a flying plane or a boat in a storm? Like just huge waves and the boat keeps tossing back and forth.That&rsquo;s great. Or a train. No wait in a fancy aquarium and you can fight on top of a whale. You fight in a building, but it keeps collapsing and you fall through the floor over and over fighting on different levels all the way down.Circus! You fight in a circus during the performance. Just total mayhem.And you can get the cannon out and shoot human cannonballs at your enemy.Sold.What about a boss? You fight through all the other assassins and what? You fight Mr. Acme?Maybe there never was a Mr. Acme. or maybe there was, but really you fight Mrs. Acme. She set it all up. She&rsquo;s the mastermind.Why?Who cares, right? At the end you fight a chopper. Just you, a chopper, and a rocket launcher.I love it.So how would this game play?Almost exactly like Smash Bros.What?

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWell that's a finished story. I think there might be a lot of editing left to do, and maybe I will add a few more paragraphs, but that's it. It's complete and might be a jumping off point for another story sometime later. I think there is quite a bit that I could explore in Uniune culture and history, so maybe I will. we'll see I guess.&ldquo;Alright. Roll your wrist inward. From the wrist not the elbow.&rdquo;&ldquo;Okay. Like this?&rdquo;&ldquo;A little slower. Do you feel the line?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes. I think? Yes.&rdquo;&ldquo;Don't pull too quickly. If the line snaps it will unravel the whole seam, and then where would we be.&rdquo;It was always the movement of the hands. Even when he was very young Kee would watch the armourer&rsquo;s hands while she worked. Watch them glide in long graceful arcs barely skimming the surface, touching off the armour gently once or twice, before darting in, elegant and violent as a striking fish. A percussive clunk delivered to the armour&rsquo;s skin would ripple through the cart. Sometimes her workbench would shake with the force of the blow. At other times, her knuckles would bend at precise angles, each finger taking up a slightly different shape, holding it briefly with invisible tension, before crisply shifting to a new position. Gentle and powerful all at once. The damaged surface of the armour would reply to these gestures and strikes by knitting back together in ways that defied simple explanation. To young eyes, skill and careful practice was the same as magic.&ldquo;Slide through the seam. You lead, the line follows.&rdquo;&ldquo;How do you know how hard to press? I can only see the surface.&rdquo;&ldquo;Only the broken edge cells will respond to pressure, so you really can&rsquo;t press too hard. Nothing you or I can do will hurt them. It&rsquo;s a lot stronger than we are. Going too shallow can be a problem though so try to press all the way through if you can.&rdquo;&ldquo;What about the line? If I press while I&rsquo;m still holding the line will it snap?&rdquo;&ldquo;You understand that it&rsquo;s not really the line that snaps, right? The line isn&rsquo;t real. The line is just a feeling. Your connection to the armour. If you keep your other hand steady while you press with this one, the line will hold. Once the cells are fused, they won&rsquo;t let go. You can&rsquo;t split them apart.&rdquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen you do it. Split a seam.&rdquo;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s different. Focus on what you&rsquo;re doing, where your hands are now. Maybe we will get to that later. In a few weeks if you keep up.&rdquo;Carts would drift into town a few times per year and set up a slapdash market. Most were loaded down with fresh fruits and exotic vegetables packed tightly into chilled boxes or stabilizer cabinets. Every few days they would get restocked by flatbeds floating lazily in and out of town. Some of them sold woven fabrics or even hand sewn clothing with dynamic, ever changing patterns bred into the fibers. Expensive, sure, but up to date fashion always is. There were carts that specialized in toys, games, and treats from beyond the front. Anything trickling in from outside the borders of Uniune was exciting so all of the town kids would flock around those carts. Kee would stop by the treat carts too, following the crowd, but as the afternoon wore on he tended to drift from his friends to linger in front of the armourer, watching her hands.The armourer&rsquo;s cart didn&rsquo;t really fit with loose semicircle of commercial carts. Why would it? Both in design and purpose it was just a different animal entirely. It sat apart from the other carts. Off to the side and behind. Shy, or looming. Difficult to tell. For an object so conspicuous the locals put forth a strong effort to ignore it. The cart kept up it&rsquo;s end of that bargain and made itself easier to ignore.&ldquo;I can fix these small cracks, but I once saw you weave an entire arm. How did you do that?&rdquo;&ldquo;Pay attention. Don&rsquo;t look at me. Keep your eyes on your work&rdquo;&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;&ldquo;No sorry, just focus.&rdquo;&ldquo;Okay. Is this right?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s a very clean seam. Close to perfect. A bit more practice. Do you feel this raised area here?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;&ldquo;That spot is just slightly weaker. It could let go there. Then again, this repair might outlive &ldquo;both of us. Hard to say. Weaving new parts is difficult. I try not to do it.&rdquo;&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;&ldquo;Because it makes me sad. Watch that seam or it will get away from you.&rdquo;&ldquo;Why sad?&rdquo;&ldquo;They only have so much in them. What do you know about armour?&rdquo;Commercial carts were uniformly sized and shaped; long rectangular metal boxes riding on lift skids or wheels mostly hidden beneath long plastic skirts. They all had the same collapsible mesh metal ramp and roll out awning extended to invite customers, welcoming them to have a look around. Much of a carts presentation was focussed on letting everyone know how profitable and popular that particular business was. Honestly, who wouldn&rsquo;t want to shop at the popular carts with their bright lights and colorful signs and soft, bouncy music. Add to that, everything they contained was something difficult or impossible to fabricate locally.Compared to the other carts the armourer&rsquo;s looked like it had accumulated and solidified by rolling over a junk heap. Panels of different colors, different decades, had been appended to the original frame. Blocky bulges broke up the carts shape at irregular intervals along the surface. Several portable engines crowned the roof of this rolling calamity. Still, the armourer&rsquo;s was the only cart with the official Uniune emblem applied to it in several places, so a certain amount of respect was owed it no matter how shabby it looked.&ldquo;Draw your hand back slowly until you feel the line catch in the bend of your third finger. You could use the second, but I find that I sometimes need the extra finger up front to brace against. &ldquo;Is there always a line? I mean, I can&rsquo;t see it. Is it always at the end of a tear like this?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes. Always. It&rsquo;s a feature of the armour. It&rsquo;s supposed to be self repairing, but some of these older ones don&rsquo;t really self anything anymore. Yes there will be a line near the end of the damage. Sometimes it can start further back than it looks on the surface, if the damage runs deep. That&rsquo;s why you reach out ahead of it like this and draw your hand back slowly. Give you the best chance of catching the line without snapping it or tangling.&rdquo;&ldquo;Like this?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes. Good. You could become very good at this.&rdquo;&ldquo;Thank you. What makes you say that?&rdquo;&ldquo;Someone has to be. Keep pressure on that seam.&rdquo;Every few months the carts would engage in a comically polite race to set up in their favorite spots. Owners dressed in impractical layered suits would nod at each other and calmly negotiate behind fake smiles until every cart found its own small plot of land. That settled, every owner would saunter down from their cart to meet with members of council, also in impractical layered suits. This dance involved a lot of hand shaking and forced laughter in the center of the market. They would share coffee and tea while staff and family set up the carts making them as enticing as they could. During this ritualistic flurry of activity the armourer&rsquo;s cart would roll to an inconspicuous, usually shady spot and silently self assemble. If you were very near, and Kee always tried to be, you could just barely hear the wire motors click on and whir into position. Despite outward appearances, the workings of the cart had been immaculately maintained. There was never so much as a squeak as the metal surfaces slid past each other. Protrusions and panels extended cleanly until the entire workshop was deployed. The whole procedure took only a few minutes. This was time the armourer used to look over a stack of papers handed to her by one of the town constables. She would sip at a steaming drink and nod occasionally, flipping through the stack of papers as the constable talked. If she ever smiled, joked, or even asked a question, Kee had never seen it.&ldquo;So you have proven you can fix them, but what do you know about them. What is this armour made from?&rdquo;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an engineered fungus blended with nanomesh and some distributed fiber processors, I think? Right?.&rdquo;&ldquo;Hmm. Yes I suppose so. That&rsquo;s the outer shell, though. I&rsquo;m talking about how it was made. How was it built&rdquo;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know.&rdquo;&ldquo;Okay then this one here. Why was it built? What was it made for?&rdquo;&ldquo;They were made for the war.&rdquo;&ldquo;They volunteered. What war?&rdquo;&rdquo;The Three Borders War.&rdquo;&ldquo;These armours served in a few wars. But this one, why are they here? We are days from the front.&rdquo;&ldquo;They come back home, right? They are supposed to come back home&rdquo;&ldquo;This armour, this one right here, is a very long way from home. I don&rsquo;t really know if they will ever get home. Not this one. Not really.&rdquo;By the time he was twelve Kee would sit beneath a tree and stare openly as the armourer worked. She must have spotted him there but she had never acknowledged him. She rarely ever looked up from her work for any reason. When he was fourteen he arrived at the market clearing before the carts, sat beneath his tree and waited.This was maybe the 14th or 15th time that Kee had watched this particular interaction play out. Every time the exchange would conclude with constables upending a flatbed loaded down with damaged and immobile armours. She would watch them tumble to the ground making a not entirely successful effort to be stone faced. As soon as the flatbed pulled away, she would walk over and crouch beside each armour in turn taking a long few seconds to contemplate it, flipping through her papers and making a few scattered notes. Then she would begin the process of dragging and aligning them into a careful triage line beside her cart.This time though, she did something startling. She stood, turned purposefully toward Kee and shouted at him. It was so unexpected and jarring that he had no idea what she had said and just stared back.&ldquo;So, come on then then.&rdquo; she added a sharp head nod that cut through Kee&rsquo;s confusion.This time he understood but still didn&rsquo;t quite know what to do, so he stood and shuffled very slowly over to where the armourer had beckoned. &ldquo;If you want to come here to help me tomorrow, you will go home and tell your parents that the armourer Ms. Eliza Quan asked for your help. If they say yes, you will be back here at 6:30 in the morning to help me move the armours and keep records.&rdquo; A long pause ended with a nod. &ldquo;Okay?&rdquo;Kee could barely keep all the instructions straight in his head, but he nodded back and exhaled a noise that might have been yes before running back home.&ldquo;Why did no one ever come to get them?&rdquo;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. How many years have you worked with me, and still you ask me these stupid questions?&rdquo;&ldquo;Liz, c&rsquo;mon, you know it&rsquo;s not stupid. They Just wander along our borders for what, 130 years now?&rdquo;&ldquo;One hundred thirty three&rdquo;&ldquo;Right. So even the SNC doesn&rsquo;t come get them. We&rsquo;ve been friendly with them almost a century.&rdquo;&ldquo;Eighty nine years come March&rdquo;&ldquo;Right. And any time they could just come get these armours from us. Any time, but they don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&ldquo;That one, the one you are working on, isn&rsquo;t SNC.&rdquo;&ldquo;I know that. It&rsquo;s just that they could. This is one is, what? Concordian?&rdquo;&ldquo;Different heat exchange along the ventral ribs. Probably DBU.&rdquo;&ldquo;DBU? You are a long way from home aren&rsquo;t you. Just need to re-weave the head of your tibia and maybe you can get back there.&rdquo;&ldquo;Nice thought. Sentimental. It could also be that we are the only two anywhere around that help them at all. Maybe no one else cares if they get home.&rdquo;&ldquo;Who do you think it is?&rdquo;Every morning during ten day market, Kee would arrive early and mark down every minor defect in the waiting line of armours. No matter how closely he examined one he would always notice a new problem. A joint degraded from decades of walking, a shoulder pauldron torn by a rock face or tree limb. Armours can withstand impressive concussive force and impacts intended to peirce. They shrug off radiation and temperature extremes, but like everything else, the abrasive grinding of movement and time can&rsquo;t be repelled.He leaned over a Concordian heavy, might have been female once, and took stock of a nonfunctional left arm. Radius riddled with microfractures, metacarpal sheath torn in three places. Maybe only two require a repair, but he would have to ask the armourer.&ldquo;The field is weak today. I picked up radio all the way from Dunway. I&rsquo;ll have it on in the shop today as long as it holds out.&rdquo; The armourer, Liz, emerged from her cart carrying her usual steaming drink, glasses flipped up onto her dark hair. Kee had been so wrapped up in examining the armour he was momentarily startled, but Liz didn&rsquo;t seem to notice. If she did, she was too polite to draw attention to it. She just looked off into the grey morning sky as it slowly warmed with the sunrise. &ldquo;Maybe there just aren&rsquo;t enough armours left out there to keep a broad field going. Don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s good or bad. Suppose it doesn&rsquo;t really matter&rdquo; She sipped at her drink. Kee wasn&rsquo;t sure if she had been talking to him or herself or no one. He supposed, like she did, that it didn&rsquo;t really matter, and went back to checking out this damaged left arm. She slowly turned to watch what Kee was doing. He ran the tip of his middle finger along the shattered radius pausing and twisting his wrist at each major break. He went back to his notes, confirmed what he had just found, and went over it again in the opposite direction.Liz spoke softly so as to not break Kee&rsquo;s concentration &ldquo;Do you want to be a warrior? An armour?&rdquo;&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so&rdquo; he answered more quickly than even he had imagined he would.&ldquo;So why are you here?&rdquo;&ldquo;I think I just want to help them. Is that what you do?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes. I think so. Usually.&rdquo; Liz sipped at her drink. &ldquo;Would you like to know how to fix that arm?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes, I think I would.&rdquo;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI recommend&nbsp;that you don't read the story now. You could, but it isn't finished and I'm still changing a lot of it. If you are interested in reading a story in a very scattered condition just to see how or if it comes together, then go right ahead. When I actually do finish it I will make sure to start the post with a note that says so. Don't worry, you won't miss it.&nbsp;&ldquo;Alright. Roll your wrist inward. From the wrist not the elbow.&rdquo;&ldquo;Okay. Like this?&rdquo;&ldquo;A little slower. Do you feel the line?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes. I think? Yes.&rdquo;&ldquo;Don't pull too quickly. If the line snaps it will unravel the whole seam.&rdquo;&nbsp;It was always the movement of the hands. Even when he was very young Kee would watch the armourer&rsquo;s hands while she worked. They would glide in long graceful arcs barely skimming the surface, touching off the armour gently once or twice, before darting in with the elegant violence of a striking fish. A percussive clunk delivered to the armour&rsquo;s skin would ripple through the cart. Sometimes her workbench would shake with the force of the blow. At other times, her knuckles would bend at precise angles, each finger taking up a slightly different shape, holding it briefly with invisible tension, before crisply shifting to a new position. Gentle and powerful all at once. The damaged surface of the armour would reply to these gestures and strikes by knitting back together in ways that defied simple explanation. To young eyes, skill and careful practice was the same as magic.&nbsp;&ldquo;Slide through the seam. You lead, it follows.&rdquo;&ldquo;How do you know how hard to press? I can only see the surface.&rdquo;&ldquo;Only the broken edge cells will respond to pressure, so you really can&rsquo;t press too hard. Nothing you or I can do will hurt them. It&rsquo;s a lot stronger than we are. Going too shallow can be a problem though so try to press all the way through if you can.&rdquo;&ldquo;What about the line? If I press while I&rsquo;m still holding the line will it snap?&rdquo;&ldquo;You understand that it&rsquo;s not really the line that snaps, right? The line isn&rsquo;t real. The line is just your connection to the armour. If you keep your other hand steady while you press with this one, the line will hold. Once the cells are fused, they won&rsquo;t let go. You can&rsquo;t split them apart.&rdquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen you do it. Split a seam.&rdquo;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s different. Focus on what you&rsquo;re doing, where your hands are now. Maybe we will get to that later.&rdquo;&nbsp;Carts would drift into town a few times per year and set up a slapdash market. Most were loaded down with fresh fruits and exotic vegetables packed tightly into chilled boxes or stabilizer cabinets. Some of them sold woven fabrics or even hand sewn clothing with dynamic, ever changing patterns bred into the fibers. Expensive, sure, but up to date fashion always is. There were carts that specialized in toys, games, and treats from beyond the front. Anything trickling in from outside the borders of Uniune was exciting so all of the town kids would flock around those carts. Kee would stop by the treat carts too, following the crowd, but as the afternoon wore on he tended to drift from his friends to linger in front of the armourer, watching her hands.The armourer&rsquo;s cart didn&rsquo;t really fit with loose semicircle of commercial carts. Why would it? Both in design and purpose it was just a different animal entirely. It sat apart from the other carts. Off to the side and behind like it didn&rsquo;t want to participate in this group photo. Shy, or looming. Difficult to tell. For an object so conspicuous the locals put forth a strong effort to ignore it. The cart kept up it&rsquo;s end of that bargain and made itself easy to ignore.&ldquo;I understand these small cracks, but I once saw you weave an entire arm. How did you do that?&rdquo;&ldquo;Pay attention. Don&rsquo;t look at me. Keep your eyes on your work&rdquo;&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;&ldquo;No sorry, just do it.&rdquo;&ldquo;Okay. Is this right?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s a very clean seam. Close to perfect. A bit more practice. Do you feel this raised area here?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;&ldquo;That spot is just slightly weaker. It could let go there. Then again, this repair might outlive both of us. Hard to say. Weaving new parts is difficult. Difficult and sad. I try not to do it.&rdquo;&ldquo;Why sad?&rdquo;&ldquo;What do you know about armour?&rdquo;&nbsp;Commercial carts were uniformly sized and shaped; long rectangular metal boxes riding on lift skids or wheels mostly hidden beneath long plastic skirts. They all had the same collapsible mesh metal ramp and roll out awning extended to invite customers, welcoming them to have a look around. Much of a carts presentation was focussed on letting everyone know how profitable and popular that particular business was. Honestly, who wouldn&rsquo;t want to shop at the popular carts with their bright lights and colorful signs and soft, bouncy music. Add to that, everything they contained was something difficult or impossible to fabricate locally.Compared to the other carts the armourer&rsquo;s looked like it had accumulated and solidified by rolling over a junk heap. Panels of different colors were patched together in awkward patterns. Cube like bulges broke up the typical cart shape at irregular intervals along the surface. Several portable engines crowned the roof of this rolling calamity. Still, the armourer&rsquo;s was the only cart with the official Uniune emblem applied to it in several places, so a certain amount of respect was owed it no matter how shabby it looked.Every few months the carts would engage in a comically polite race to set up in their favorite spots. Owners would nod at each other and calmly negotiate behind fake smiles until every cart found its own small plot of land. That settled, every owner would saunter down from their cart to meet with the locals in the middle of the temporary market. This dance involved a lot of hand shaking and forced laughter. They would share coffee and tea while staff and family set up the carts making them as enticing as they could. During this ritualistic flurry of activity the armourer&rsquo;s cart would roll to an inconspicuous, usually shady spot and silently self assemble. If you were very near, and Kee always tried to be, you could just barely hear the wire motors click on and whir into position. Despite outward appearances, the workings of the cart had been immaculately maintained. There was never so much as a squeak as the metal surfaces slid past each other. Protrusions and panels extended cleanly until the entire workshop was deployed. The whole procedure took only a few minutes. This was time the armourer used to look over a stack of papers handed to her by one of the town constables. She would sip at a steaming drink and nod occasionally, flipping through the stack of papers as the constable talked. If she ever smiled, joked, or even asked a question, Kee had never seen it.&nbsp;&ldquo;What is this armour made from?&rdquo;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an engineered fungus blended with nanomesh and some distributed nanologic, I think.&rdquo;&ldquo;Hmm. Yes I suppose so. That&rsquo;s the outer shell, how was it made. How was it built&rdquo;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know.&rdquo;&ldquo;Why was it built?

Okay?&rdquo;Kee could barely keep all the instructions straight in his head, but he nodded and exhaled a noise that might have been \"yes\"&nbsp;before running back home.&nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - The Oregon Trail&nbsp;The phrase &ldquo;you have died of dysentery&rdquo; shouldn&rsquo;t really spark fond nostalgia. The prospect of adhering to a grueling pace on meager rations shouldn&rsquo;t elicit joy. There is narrow demographic for whom choosing to ford or float across a river while several of your family members suffered from measles and fever was the best part of the school day. Presented as educational fare, I think the only thing that anyone ever really learned from The Oregon Trail was to buy lots of bullets instead of food. Food you could hunt 100 pounds at a time while on the trail. Money was next to worthless west of the 100th meridian but life and death pivot on oxen and wagon axles. Finally, and without exception, all pioneers must float down the columbia river. These are the lessons taught by The Oregon Trail. This was the information that a generation or three retained, extracted from Apple II computers lodged at the backs of classrooms across north america. I played it again today. The Oregon Trail is still one of the best games.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tSince I am always anywhere from 6 months to 3 years behind on games, I recently started playing Metal Gear Solid V. So far I find myself in agreement with 90% of popular opinion on this game. I think it is fantastic. That would be the smart place to leave it. Just acknowledge that I like the game and move on. I can go play it, enjoy myself, and not try to overanalyze it. If you have read any of these posts, you know that isn&rsquo;t how I function. Figuring out why one game is more enjoyable than another game is sort of my jam. Saying things like &ldquo;my jam&rdquo; is also my jam. The full extent of the jam. So, getting back to it, this is what I think makes Metal Gear Solid V a good game. It waits. This is a trait in great games that I have written a little about before. The Souls series of games is probably the most celebrated for waiting. By waiting, I mean that the game is happy to wait for the player to initiate play. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that the game is slow or that it lacks intensity. It means that the design of the game is player reliant. When you start a game of Robotron 2084 your character appears at the center of the screen and a horde of robots converge on you until either you clear the level and move on to the next or they touch you and the game ends. If you start the game and then lift your hands from the controls the robots will quickly close on you and end the game. The game system is player centric, but not player reliant. It will play itself to an end state with or without you. With the exception of a few timed missions, MGSV is pretty willing to let the player take everything at their own pace. Want to lay down by a rock during a mission and research dog armor? Go for it. Want to retry that mission but only use grenades / sniper rifles / inflatable decoys? Not a problem. Want to run one mission over and over until you can finish it in a minute and a half? You can, and the game even expects that you might. This waiting is different from a game that simply has no combat in an area or requires you to move to a new arena passing through an invisible switch that starts the next wave or puzzle. Even fairly sophisticated games that fall under that category, like the Uncharted series for example, really aren&rsquo;t that much different from Robotron. You move from level to level, often without any indication that you have, and the game presents you with challenges that, in the case of combat, play out with or without your input. Waiting is when a game operates in one state until the player chooses to trigger a new state through interaction. If the game provides a lot of options for how, when, and why the player triggers a new state, manipulating the system becomes the source of fun. This sort of goes back to my theory that fun is when our brains predict patterns from apparent chaos. A game system that waits until poked by a player offers pattern resolving opportunities by the bagful. This isn&rsquo;t to say that level or wave based games aren&rsquo;t fun, they can be phenomenal, but they are player centric not player reliant. The player centric system will play out the simulation to an end point regardless of what the player does or doesn&rsquo;t do. The player reliant system will just run. It&rsquo;s possible that it would run forever while waiting for the player to interact with it. Even after the player manipulates the system it can keep running and never actually end the simulation. You as the player are required for the system to change, but the simulation is never driving toward any particular state. It just waits. It waits for you. There, I took the time to write this, when really what I wanted to do the whole time is go back to playing MGSV. It&rsquo;s late now, but maybe just one quick mission.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI work on 3D models almost every day. Often I am creating new ones for 3D printing or game assets. Sometimes I am fixing up or prepping ones already created by someone else. I can say with some certainty that there is no right way to create a 3D model. There are techniques that suit certain situations but there is no fundamentally correct way to make a 3D model. None.This is when scores of people authoring hours of tutorials can tell me that I am wrong. They can point out all of the industry professionals that use process Y and how much better and faster and more efficient it is that process X. Complete Rubbish. There is no right way to create a 3D model. There are a lot of wrong ways, I have seen the results of many of them, but there is no right way.I&rsquo;ve been at this for a long time. Maybe too long. The tools and techniques change, but the end result never really has. If you are creating a model with the intention of animating it there are certain requirements. If you are creating a model to be fed into a cnc system like a milling machine or 3d printer there are other requirements. If the model is for use in an interactive system with controls and physics like a game or simulation there are, again, different requirements. How you build the model, the tools you use, just doesn&rsquo;t matter. If you are reading this, I didn&rsquo;t write this for you. I wrote it for me. I just need to remind myself every once in awhile that the tools don&rsquo;t matter. You can use all of them or none of them and the model that you end up with is the only thing that matters. &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - CentipedeI usually try to steer clear of the classics. Those games that are universally loved. Pillars of the art form. Games like Pac-Man, The Legend of Zelda, Castlevania Symphony of the Night. It&rsquo;s not that they aren&rsquo;t up there on the list with the best games. It&rsquo;s just that those games, the classics, have been discussed so often and dissected so thoroughly that there isn&rsquo;t a lot of mystery left to them. The whys and hows of their lasting quality is fairly well understood by folks who study games. If I&rsquo;m going to write about the hundreds, maybe thousands, of games that can be held up as properly wonderful, I may as well choose some that deserve a little extra attention.Centipede is an exception to the rule. Centipede is rightly credited as not only one of the best games of the 80&rsquo;s but as one of the best videogames of all time. It&rsquo;s fast, engaging, and beautiful. So why write about it? Why repeat what anyone who follows videogames has read many times before? There is a unique core to the design of Centipede that I don&rsquo;t think gets talked or written about enough and it deserves praise.Centipede is all about the player.The usual factoids on the design of Centipede center around the choices of Dona Bailey, one of the first women programming arcade games during the formative years of the industry. The vibrant, shifting, pastel colour palette, and the fantastical garden setting are applauded. Centipede is noted for its universal appeal, attracting male and female players equally. Maybe the colors or the rollerball control play some part in the success of Centipede, but I think there is something much more fundamental at play here.Centipede is all about the player.Centipede is, like a lot of the games of its era, an evolution of Space Invaders. You sit at the bottom of the screen and shoot directly up at enemies cascading down. That is the challenge you must overcome. Here is the difference. In Space Invaders and most of the games like it when the enemies reach the bottom of the screen the game is over. You lose. There is a limited amount of time that you are able to play unless you actively assail the enemy. The enemies in Centipede can reach the bottom and they just turn around and start heading back up. Your player character has a limited band that it must stay in near the bottom of the screen but other than that your movement is unrestricted. You can move side to side, up and down, and even on smooth diagonals. Any way you can roll the ball controller, you can move. After it hits the bottom, the centipede will also stay in this band, moving back and forth and stepping up or down with each turn. You don&rsquo;t have to shoot the centipede. You can dodge forever, never shooting, or you can choose to shoot the mushrooms scattered across the playfield. The game is very difficult and it becomes faster and more difficult as time wears on, but you don&rsquo;t have to fight. You get to choose when and how you fight.As you play, there are enemies that add new mushrooms to the screen but you can decide which ones you would like to shoot and remove or leave where they are. You can mold the random playfield to your advantage. You decide. Where most of the Space Invaders derivatives test your ability to dismantle orderly columns of enemies before time runs out, Centipede presents chaos and variability that you get to decide how to deal with. You can organize the chaos into manageable groups and lines, or you can let the chaos expand and deal with the oncoming assault on a case by case basis. You can also choose not to shoot, waiting for precisely selected moments to attack. Centipede is one of the best games of all time, but it has less to do with the color palette and more to do with how it treat the player. Playing Centipede, you get to choose what happens next.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWhen I said that the story was finished before, I lied. I had always intended to have a sort of twilight zone style coda on the story. If you read the semi uplifting ending I had before, that was sort of a fake out. So here is a completed first/second/third draft. I promise next week will be something new. &nbsp;We called it the forest. It was only a few hundred trees along the riverbank. If you stood in just the right spot and looked at just the right angle you could see clear through them - from the stubble field on one side to the ripening durum across the river. &nbsp;Surrounding the forest for as far as you could see was mile upon mile of sun blasted, wind swept prairie. For us this was the forest.By 10 am, the baking heat would be unbearable. The trees might not have been much, but they stood thick enough to provide a little shade.Bing was riding his Kuwahara. Chrome silver with black accents in liquid smooth powder coat. I had a rust spotted CCM bmx frame adorned with a mish mash of parts pulled from dead bikes. Bing&rsquo;s bike was the envy of all the local kids but I prefered my frankenstein bike. It could hit a jump in just the right way. A smooth launch, a little give on the landings. The Kuwahara had footpegs, better hand brakes, and a brand new chain, but it felt a little too unforgiving. Antagonistic. It confronted the ground rather than rolling over it. Also, Bing was always on it.The sun hadn&rsquo;t really gotten going yet so the air was still a little cool. Wet streams drifted to the corners of my eyes as my feet spun the pedals. We didn&rsquo;t talk but I could hear Bing breathing hard off to my left. We hadn&rsquo;t really discussed it but we both knew where we were headed. Since late spring we had been building a jump in the forest. Greg Stevens had swiped a shovel from his garden shed and left it out there last summer. He had some plan for digging a WW1 trench and camping in it. His shovel caper resulted in a pit about two feet deep and four feet across. He couldn&rsquo;t even lay in it without crunching up his legs. Greg decided not to bring the shovel back since his dad had blamed the neighbor and bought a new one. Now it was our primary jump construction tool, and the trench was our main excavation point.We would all take turns scooping up some dirt from the trench and adding to the jump. Over a couple of weeks, it had gone from a small bump crowning the edge of a natural ditch, to a loose kicker a couple feet high. We had ridden over the Jump dozens, maybe hundreds of times, but only the center had packed down properly. The rest of the jump was a pile of loose, soft dirt. Hitting it too fast or not dead center could end your run real quick. You might spin off to the side, dump the bike right there, or stop dead and go over the handlebars. Honestly it was hard to tell what might happen, except that it would probably be bad. We would bang on the jump with the shovel, or ride over it slowly, but without some rain to really tamp it down, it was just too scary to hit the jump properly, at full speed.I made it to the edge of the forest where our jump was under construction and locked up my brakes on the loose dirt. I leaned hard, kicking out my back tire, planting my inside foot and sliding to a tripod stop. Bing, right behind me, did the same, but maybe not with quite as much style.I gave the ramp a quick once over to see if any work had been done on it in the past couple of days. Swimming lessons had prevented me from making the ride to work on it but there were about five of us that regularly came out here who also knew where the shovel was stashed. From the landing slope all the way up &nbsp;to the crown the ramp was devastated. It was all deep gouges turning up the soft soil underneath. &ldquo;If they are gonna ride on it, they should at least stomp it down&rdquo; Bing griped between winded huffs.I silently agreed and made a sour face. Older kids had been coming out at night with BMXs and an 80cc dirt bike. The BMX tracks weren&rsquo;t that noticeable but the dirt bike had left the ramp in an unusable state. They might as well have run a rototiller over it. I stepped off my bike and let it fall to the ground in disgust. I had been hoping to take a couple of slow runs and maybe catch a little air before doing any construction work. Bing shoved out his kickstand and stepped off. He rhythmically slammed his hightops into the soft earth while I fumed into the forest to retrieve the shovel.We kept the shovel up in a tree. It had been Bing&rsquo;s idea. I would never tell him I thought so, but he could be pretty clever when he tried.Shovel Tree was a little way past the Party Pit, an open area surrounded by trees. &nbsp;This clearing was regularly used by older kids for the kind of illicit late night parties where someone would mess up a ramp - so the shovel had to be hidden far enough from those jerks that it wasn&rsquo;t likely to be seen. The tree we settled on was down nearer the river and had lost a branch about 15 feet up its trunk. The bony remnant sticking out from the tree was a perfect place to hang a shovel handle. The lower branches stuck out in such a way that you could really only see the shovel hanging there when you were right underneath it. To hide or retrieve the thing required a daring leap from a nearby stump. You climbed up the stump, maybe a little more than waist height from the ground, jumped toward Shovel Tree, and either plucked or hung it all in one continuous motion. You then had the option of trying to hang on to the shovel, dragging it with you while avoiding the lower branches, or tossing it over your shoulder and hoping it didn&rsquo;t slice the back of your neck on the way down. I had seen both methods attempted successfully and unsuccessfully, but I never saw anyone get hurt. At least not badly enough that it would require telling a parent what had happened. I usually opted for the &lsquo;carry the shovel down with you&rsquo; method, since that always seemed the least likely to result in a head wound. It might have been a clever way of hiding the shovel but, because it was a Bing solution, that meant a higher than average risk of injury.I snagged the shovel off of Shovel Tree and started back through the clearing. Bing was standing there nudging his toe against a discarded beer can. He looked up at me.&ldquo;Listen man, we don&rsquo;t have to work on this today. We can head back into town. Find something else to do. We cou-&rdquo;&ldquo;No!&rdquo; I surprised myself with how loud I yelled at him. Surprised him too. We bickered, even tore into each other from time to time, but always as friends. I had crossed a line.We just sort of stared at each other for a moment, feeling the waves of what was going on wash over us. Finally, he curled his lip, flatly said &ldquo;dick&rdquo;, and stomped out of the clearing to go sit in the dirt beside the Kuwahara.I had been in a sour mood since I picked him up at his house. I saw the boxes packed in the garage. It hadn&rsquo;t really occurred to me that Bing might be feeling the same way. It was his family that was moving. His life that was getting lifted up and drifted across the country. I would still have my other friends here. Where they had always been. I was losing my best friend but he was losing everyone. I didn&rsquo;t say that to him of course. I just started digging and slapping down dirt. Swinging line drives with the flat of the shovel against the ruined side of our ramp. Our ramp. Mine and Bing&rsquo;s ramp. Other kids worked on it too, but it was just us two who had started it. I rammed the shovel down hard into the center of the trench. I was angry at the dirt. I was angry at Bing. I was angry at Bing&rsquo;s dad for getting a better job. I was angry at the kids who tore up our ramp. I was angry at the increasingly unbearable heat of the day. I was angry at me. I really didn't know what I was angry at. I stabbed the shovel as deeply as could.The next thing I knew, I was laying belly down beside the hole holding my chin where it had bounced off the shovel handle.I looked up to see Bing standing over me. My face was probably a mix of astonished and accusing, but Bing just stared right past me at the hole, eyes like pie plates.&ldquo;What in the hell, man?&rdquo; Bing blurted out, less to me, and more to the shovel as he reached down to take hold of it. It took a couple of firm yanks to dislodge the shovel. Whatever it had sunk into made a strange rattling, sucking sound. Like a reverse burp. I stood back up shoulder to shoulder with Bing, earlier animosities abandoned. Just like that, we had reset, united in our bewilderment.&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; I probed.&ldquo;Umm. Maybe like a crack or cave or something? Maybe you punched through into a cave?&rdquo;Neither of us believed that. Neither of us had ever seen a cave in the middle of a broad, flat, prairie. When Bing had hauled the shovel up bits of powdery wood had come up with it. Old dessicated fibers that had, at one time, been milled lumber. The edges were too clean and regular to be tree roots or buried deadfall. &ldquo;What about the wood?&rdquo; I was already piecing together a picture in my mind of what I had &ldquo;punched through&rdquo; so I floated out questions to see if Bing was thinking along the same lines. I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to voice what I was thinking.&ldquo;Why would someone bury a wood box by the river?&rdquo; Bing asked, walking the assumption forward to include not just wood, but a wooden box. He mirrored my tone and I could see dread ripple across his expression, before replacing it with a nervous grin. &ldquo;Is this a casket? Did you just jam a shovel into some dead guy&rsquo;s casket?&rdquo; Bing&rsquo;s smile widened into a full toothed display. &ldquo;Gross!&rdquo;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that. We don&rsquo;t know what it is!&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t help it. I was grinning now too. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably just old wood someone tossed out. And buried. On purpose. Beside the river.&rdquo;We traded conspiratorial looks but neither of us budged.&ldquo;Go check.&rdquo;&ldquo;You go check.&rdquo;&ldquo;You found it&rdquo;&ldquo;You have the shovel.&rdquo;We both took a step forward and arched over the hole. Bing used the tip of the shovel to &nbsp;begin a ginger excavation, careful and tense. Neither of us wanted to uncover anything grizzly, but then again, we absolutely wanted to uncover something grizzly. Something valuable. Something amazing.My heart was beating so hard my hands shook with each pulse. Light glinted off something metallic a few inches below the soil and my whole body lurched. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s treasure!&rdquo; The words exploded from my throat.Bing stopped clearing dirt and squinted at me. He feigned excited endorsement but sarcasm dripped from every word. &ldquo;Do you think pirates put it here? Sailed it up the river?&rdquo; Then he tagged his comment with our favored insult to really make sure it stuck. &ldquo;Child.&rdquo;&ldquo;Shut up. It&rsquo;s something shiny. There&rsquo;s something metal down there. It&rsquo;s metal in a box&rdquo;If Bing had any intention of spending more time poking fun at me, his curiosity overcame it. We crouched down, relatively sure that we weren&rsquo;t going to be nose to nose with a mummified corpse.Enough dirt had been cleared away that we could start to make out the shape of what we had found. The sun had been climbing in the sky and was almost directly above now, more clearly revealing the shapes below us. Squatting to take a lower angle, I could make out a rounded metal edge. Maybe a large plate, or disc almost filling a box about two feet square. Bing reached in, taking hold of the metal, and just as quickly dropped it, recoiling his hand.&ldquo;What! What happened?&rdquo; I demanded.&ldquo;Damn it! That&rsquo;s cold!&rdquo; he had his finger tips tucked under his armpit and rocked back and forth in wincing pain. He pulled out his fingers and looked at them. They seemed fine. No visible wounds or bleeding. He shook his hand aggressively in front of his bared teeth like a fan made of sausages. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yeah, fine. Damn it, that is ice cold. It feels like burning, but cold, man.&rdquo;I wrapped my hand in the belly of my T-shirt and stretched it down to slowly touch the metal. Nothing. It felt hard and maybe a little cool, but nothing like what Bing was on about.&ldquo;It feels normal. Just like metal. Are you messing with me?&rdquo;&ldquo;No. It was like frostbite, man. Still hurts a little.&rdquo;I took my hand out of my shirt and tentatively brushed a fingertip across the metal. Then all my fingers. Then the flat of my hand. A little cool, hard, metallic. Certainly not burning cold or frostbite cold. I reached my fingers down under the edge and grabbed hold. The plate was incredibly thin, like foil, but solid and unyielding. I pressed hard with my fingertips but the metal didn&rsquo;t bend or crumple. Although paper thin, the edge felt round and smooth, not sharp. I started lifting the circle of metal and found it so light that it didn&rsquo;t seem to have any substance at all. It took some twisting and wrangling to pull it from the box, since the hole we had cut wasn&rsquo;t quite large enough.I set the disk on the ground between us, now fully visible under the full midday sun. We didn&rsquo;t move. We didn&rsquo;t breath. The only sounds were leaves twisting in a light breeze and the distant buzz of insects. It was treasure. It was beautiful and frightening and impossible. Around the circular rim of the thing was metal, sure enough. A dull silvery metal with lines and markings along its circumference. Like a clock face, but with the minute marks set to irregular periods and angles. An interesting and unusual example of manufactured metal work. That part of the object I could wrap my mind around. What sat in the center of the ring was different. It was black. Just black. No reflections, no variation in the surface, no shadows. Light didn&rsquo;t play off it. Encircled by a band of paper thin metal, there on the ground sat nothing. Nothing at all. I felt my hand reaching before I had fully considered what I was doing. The middle finger of my left hand barely alighting on the black in the center of the disc. Just as unconsciously, I recoiled. The freezing, burning, cold was a shock.&ldquo;Cold, right?&rdquo; Bing spouted gleefully.I let out a cartoonishly long &ldquo;ooowwwww!&rdquo; that ended in wide smile. &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s like liquid or something. My fingers sunk right into it.&rdquo; He mimed the wide grip he had used to try to pick the disc up. &ldquo;What do you think it is?&rdquo;&ldquo;No clue. Like a part off some old machine or something. How long do you think it was buried?&rdquo; I rubbed at my fingertip until the feeling returned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s well up past the water line, and the ground around it is pretty dry. It had to be down there a long time for the wood to be so rotten.&rdquo; Bing shrugged and slowly shook his head. &ldquo;Hundred years maybe? I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; &ldquo;A hundred years? That&rsquo;s like, really old. Like pioneer old.&rdquo; I stood up and snagged the shovel off the ground where Bing had dumped it.&ldquo;What are you going to do with that?&rdquo;&ldquo;Just checking something.&rdquo;I hovered the blade of the shovel over the center of that black circle. No reflection. I could see the shadow cast from the shovel run over Bing&rsquo;s sneaker, across the ground, onto the metal ring, and just sort of end at the black. Cautiously I lowered the shovel until the tip just touched the black surface, or at least I thought it did. It was almost impossible to tell. All the visual feedback I had come to expect sort of didn&rsquo;t exist here, and I could feel my eyes struggling to find a point to focus on. I braced myself, expecting that same cold bite to crawl it&rsquo;s way up the shovel and into my bare hands. It didn&rsquo;t. Instead I felt a soft resistance, like the skin of a dried pudding cup. A small amount of downward pressure and I could see the blade of the shovel slip out of existence.Bing must have been holding his breath because he exhaled with a long whistle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so weird.&rdquo;&ldquo;Yeah&rdquo; I agreed. &ldquo;Feels kind of thick. Like stirring gravy or something.&rdquo; I pulled the shovel back up to check that it was still intact. It seemed okay. Even the clumps of dirt stuck along the edges seemed unperturbed. &ldquo;How deep do you think it is?&rdquo;I offered the handle to Bing. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Check it out.&rdquo;Bing proceeded to plunge the shovel until it was halfway submerged in the center of the black circle.&ldquo;Is that it?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yeah. Seems like.&rdquo; He bobbed the shovel a couple of times, each time stopping at the same spot along the handle. &ldquo;It hit something.&rdquo;He drove it down a little harder and I could hear a muffled, distant, thunk. The shovel was maybe a foot and a half deep. A foot and a half gone, as far as we could tell. Bing moved to lift the shovel back up.I waved my hands at him. &ldquo;Just wait. Just wait. I want to try something.&rdquo;I crouched down and carefully took hold of the metal ring. My finger still tingled a bit where I had touched the black, so I kept them well back from the inner edge. Just like before, I lifted the disc and was surprised at how little it weighed. There was almost nothing to it, like a rigid piece of tissue paper, but the breeze didn&rsquo;t seem to affect it at all. &ldquo;Are you still holding the shovel down? Like all the way down?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yeah, It&rsquo;s just sitting there. I&rsquo;m not even pushing it. It&rsquo;s just resting on the ground, or whatever. The ground at the bottom of that hole thing.&rdquo;I got down low, almost resting my head in the dirt. Under the raised disc, I could see the ground, the shadow cast by the metal ring and the shovel handle. On the other side were Bing&rsquo;s high tops, patches of grass, and our ramp. Nothing else. No shovel handle, no shovel blade. I reached up with my right hand and pushed down on the shovel handle where Bing still had hold of it. It didn&rsquo;t budge. It was passing through the ring and resting on something I couldn&rsquo;t see. I waved the ring up and down a little. The exposed parts of the shovel stayed put. &ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re right. It&rsquo;s like a hole or something, but you can move it around. It&rsquo;s so cool! Scary, but cool.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t even try to keep the grin out of my voice.We spent the next couple hours poking at the thing and laughing. We dropped in rocks and pine cones and watched them slowly slip through the black surface to disappear from view, seemingly forever. We stabbed it with tree branches and drew them back out, chilled but unharmed. Bing tried to ring the bell off the Kuwahara with a stick while it was on the other side of the black, but we couldn&rsquo;t hear it very well. Just a whisper of dull metallic clanging. The experiment required getting his hands dangerously close to that nipping cold surface so he didn&rsquo;t try it for long. I moved the shovel around on the other side feeling for its limits. It seemed fairly small, I could probably have reached every part of the hollow on the other side if I sunk my arm up to the shoulder, but that would have been crazy.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m parched.&rdquo; Bing licked his lips and sighed, sitting down heavily on a clump of grass.&ldquo;Yeah. Me too. I have to get home for supper too.&rdquo; We had completely ignored thirst and hunger while we examined our find. Now that I had stopped for a moment I felt fatigue press down on me and we finally rested. Bing sprawled on the ground while I drooped limply over the shovel. &ldquo;What do we do with this thing?&rdquo;I imagined trying to carry it home on my bike and couldn&rsquo;t really figure a way to do it. The disc was light and strong but it was too large to tuck under an arm. Maybe Bing would attempt it but I wouldn&rsquo;t risk that black stuff touching my bare skin while I was trying to pedal.&ldquo;Somebody will see it if we try carrying it back into town. It&rsquo;s not the kind of thing that anyone would ignore.&rdquo; Bing offered, head cocked to the side, eyes squinting. &ldquo;Maybe we can hang it on the shovel?&rdquo;I swiftly laid the blade of the shovel flat in the black until I could hook the top edges under the ring and fish it up off the ground. The disc just dangled there off the shovel like I had plucked it from a carnival pond game. Bing reached out and gave a firm tug on the ring. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how or why that works, but it doesn&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;s going anywhere.&rdquo;We headed over to Shovel Tree and this time Bing made the leap to hang both the shovel and the disc. The glint of the metal ring might catch the eye of someone skulking around over here but even in the mildest of shadows the rest of the disc just disappeared. It would have to do until we could find some better place to keep the thing. On the way back to pick up our bikes we kicked as much dirt as we could into the rotten box. We couldn&rsquo;t fill it. We would have had to go back and get the shovel for that but we disguised the square corners of the box well enough that it would hopefully pass for just another pit dug to add to the bike ramp.We both took one slow pass at the jump before heading back into town.I didn&rsquo;t tell anyone what we had found. That night I didn&rsquo;t sleep for a second.One week later, Bing was gone. His mom and dad had been packing all summer, gathering the contents of their single story house into the garage and loading it into a rented box truck. One morning, the truck wasn&rsquo;t there. I rode my bike past the house. Like a snail shell you find along the shore, it still carried all of the evidence of life only now it was empty. Not just empty, hollow. I knew that they were leaving. I knew that they had wanted to move before school started. Bing and his sister would be going to a new school, in a new city. I suppose I just didn&rsquo;t expect him to be gone.A few days later I rode out to the forest alone and just sat there looking at the river and brushing off mosquitoes.For that whole week we tried not to talk at all about Bing moving. It helped that we were completely enthralled with The Hole. At some point during the week we started calling it &ldquo;The Hole&rdquo; and the moniker stuck. We moved it to a more remote part of the forest and tested anything we could think of. We had put sticks, rocks, bits of cloth, action figures. Anything we could find that we didn&rsquo;t mind losing went into The Hole. Bing dipped an old radio halfway into the black and it stopped playing almost instantly. It looked fine but the batteries had gone completely dead. We used a towel and an oven mitt in an attempt to press our hands through the viscous surface. It always ended with one of us vibrating on the ground, fingers shoved deep into our mouth or armpit to restore circulation while the other one pointed and laughed. We talked about telling someone about the hole. Our parents. Our friends. A science lab maybe. We didn&rsquo;t know of any labs in our town and we couldn&rsquo;t even agree on what sort of scientist would study this thing. Bing said that he should take it with him.He started in sheepishly, as if this was all coming to him now, but soon he was laying down words with a &nbsp;salesman's patter. &ldquo;There has to be somebody at the university that would know what to do with it. Maybe they can test it and find out how it works. Maybe we can sell it. The Hole is probably military or NASA tech. Maybe there is a reward. I should probably take it, you know, so we can get it checked out or something.&rdquo; &nbsp;The idea hadn&rsquo;t just occurred to him. Bing was a poor liar. He had been thinking about taking The Hole with him for a while.I could feel my jaw tighten involuntarily. I was barely aware of my hands curling to fists. When the loud, shrill &ldquo;NO!&rdquo; burst out of me it took a moment to register that I was the one yelling.In an instant we were locked in a clumsy wrestlers clinch. I was dimly aware of the disc of black between us at our feet. I caught Bing's eyes as they flicked down to The Hole and then back up to mine. We stared for a few short seconds until a puzzled look drifted across Bing. I would have to imagine that I looked equally confused. Bing spoke first.&ldquo;What are we doing?&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;&ldquo;This is stupid, right?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yeah. You&rsquo;re stupid.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t hold back the chuckle.We both pulled away and took a step back. Laughing was the only apology either of us would offer or accept. That was how it worked between best friends.Of course, Bing had taken The Hole. He had ridden back out after supper with an empty briefcase before it got packed up for the move. There was no way that the disc would have fit in a regular sized case but the metal ring was so incredibly thin that he must have been able to close it well enough to bike it back home. He had stowed it somewhere in the box truck before his parents could see it and they had taken it with them. Out of town and across the country. And I was out there, in the forest, sitting alone among the sounds of a late summer evening. Small birds singing to each other and buzzing, hissing insects gathering along the riverbank in clouds that danced in the gentle breeze. That&rsquo;s when I heard something different. A distant tapping, like drums being played underwater. There was a thunk and a tip, tip, tap, followed by a scraping sound that was so faint that I could barely detect it.I tried to follow the sounds by sweeping my head low to the ground and narrowing in on the source. I must have looked like snake tasting the air. Just outside the clearing and getting close to the ramp I got down and put my head right up against the ground. The sounds were coming from down there.After discovering one impossible thing in the forest I wasn&rsquo;t going to leave without fully investigating another.The evening light was starting to fade by the time I finally dug through to the second box. The first one had rotted almost to powder having been buried for such a long time. This one was mostly intact. It was built from the same roughly milled lumber but the wood still had some strength to it. I had to dig around the top until I made enough room for the lid to open. There were remnants of old leather and fiber straps that must have bound the whole box together but those hadn&rsquo;t held up the way the wood had. I wedged the tip of the shovel under the edge of the lid and used it as a lever to pry the lid off. The night was cooling but I was vibrating and sweating so hard there must have been steam rising off my back.The old wood sent up a squealing creak before finally cracking apart. The lid flipped back like the cover of a book before slamming down into the newly dug soil. There, strapped to the lid with wooden planks was an almost perfect duplicate of The Hole.The metal disc was sandwiched between the planks and the lid along two of the sides leaving the black in the center completely exposed. The nails driven through the planks were rough and square. Whoever secured the Hole had tried to drive one of the nails through the metal disc but it was bent over and flattened into the wood. Laying in the bottom of the box was an assortment of rocks, pinecones, sticks, bits of paper, toy cars, and action figures. I lifted a Greedo from the box and turned it over in my hand. Two-tone green plastic in an ancient wooden box. This was my Greedo, the one that I had dropped through the other Hole. The Hole that Bing had taken with him. I dropped to my knees &nbsp;and scrabbled in the dirt for a sharp rock. I held my Greedo in one hand and tried desperately to steady my other hand. The tremors radiated through my entire body as I used the rock to scrape two rough but readable letters into Greedo&rsquo;s chest.HI. If I had spoken them there would be no way I could have held back the tears.I let the Greedo slip from my fingers. With held breath I watched as it slowly sunk into the black and out of view. I hoisted the box lid, bulky but manageable, and sprinted to my bike. The wood made my ride home difficult but I could have carried five of them and still made it back. It was almost like carrying nothing at all. More than twenty years later, I still keep in touch with Bing. We use phones and computers now. Sometimes we get our families together. Our wives are friends and his kids are a little younger than mine. We might only talk about The Holes once every few years but only face to face and only when we are sure that we are alone. Even then the only thing we discuss is who we should tell and when. For now the safest thing we can think to do is to leave them where they are. Mine is tied the lid of a locked metal box I got from an army surplus shop. The box is lag bolted to the cement floor in my condo storage locker. The condo board probably wouldn&rsquo;t be happy about me hammer drilling into the floor but I&rsquo;ll take that risk. Bing keeps his behind a false wall he built into his basement. It&rsquo;s sandwiched between two heavy pieces of an old cast iron stove.It was the two incidents that had convinced us. The first, of course, was when I had removed my disc from the wooden box lid. We had been testing The Holes for months, maybe a year, sending objects and notes back and forth before I used a pry bar to peel the wood planks away. I had studied the image behind the disc for hours. I&rsquo;m still not completely certain what everything I saw burnt into the wood meant. I tried describing it in notes to Bing and when that failed I took a polaroid and pushed that through the black. It didn&rsquo;t take long after than for both of us to agree that we would have to be very careful with the Holes. The second was when Bing&rsquo;s disc opened. He had flipped his disc over and he told me later that the normally solid, seamless, metal was open in the center. Open like a door or a window revealing another black surface just as flat and featureless as the one on the other side. Bing said that he poked the handle of a putter into the Hole and it had been yanked from his hands. He almost hadn&rsquo;t been able to let go of it in time. Suddenly the image burnt into the wood made a lot more sense. We have hidden and secured the Holes as thoroughly as we could. With every move we try to improve security, sharing notes on our solutions. Hopefully, one day we can figure out where to put them or who give them to. Until then, we will keep them separated and keep them safe and remain terrified of what will happen if we don&rsquo;t.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWe have an ending. Is it THE ending. Maybe, maybe not. I haven't 100% decided. Let me know if you think there should be more.We called it the forest. It was only a few hundred trees along the riverbank. If you stood in just the right spot and looked at just the right angle you could see clear through them - from the stubble field on one side to the ripening durum across the river. &nbsp;Surrounding the forest for as far as you could see was mile upon mile of sun blasted, wind swept prairie. For us this was the forest.By 10 am, the baking heat would be unbearable. The trees might not have been much, but they stood thick enough to provide a little shade.Bing was riding his Kuwahara. Chrome silver with black accents in liquid smooth powder coat. I had a rust spotted CCM bmx frame adorned with a mish mash of parts pulled from dead bikes. Bing&rsquo;s bike was the envy of all the local kids but I prefered my frankenstein bike. It could hit a jump in just the right way. A smooth launch, a little give on the landings. The Kuwahara had footpegs, better hand brakes, and a brand new chain, but it felt a little too unforgiving. Antagonistic. It confronted the ground rather than rolling over it. Also, Bing was always on it.The sun hadn&rsquo;t really gotten going yet so the air was still a little cool. Wet streams drifted to the corners of my eyes as my feet spun the pedals. We didn&rsquo;t talk but I could hear Bing breathing hard off to my left. We hadn&rsquo;t really discussed it but we both knew where we were headed. Since late spring we had been building a jump in the forest. Greg Stevens had swiped a shovel from his garden shed and left it out there last summer. He had some plan for digging a WW1 trench and camping in it. His shovel caper resulted in a pit about two feet deep and four feet across. He couldn&rsquo;t even lay in it without crunching up his legs. Greg decided not to bring the shovel back since his dad had blamed the neighbor and bought a new one. Now it was our primary jump construction tool, and the trench was our main excavation point.We would all take turns scooping up some dirt from the trench and adding to the jump. Over a couple of weeks, it had gone from a small bump crowning the edge of a natural ditch, to a loose kicker a couple feet high. We had ridden over the Jump dozens, maybe hundreds of times, but only the center had packed down properly. The rest of the jump was a pile of loose, soft dirt. Hitting it too fast or not dead center could end your run real quick. You might spin off to the side, dump the bike right there, or stop dead and go over the handlebars. Honestly it was hard to tell what might happen, except that it would probably be bad. We would bang on the jump with the shovel, or ride over it slowly, but without some rain to really tamp it down, it was just too scary to hit the jump properly, at full speed.I made it to the edge of the forest where our jump was under construction and locked up my brakes on the loose dirt. I leaned hard, kicking out my back tire, planting my inside foot and sliding to a tripod stop. Bing, right behind me, did the same, but maybe not with quite as much style.I gave the ramp a quick once over to see if any work had been done on it in the past couple of days. Swimming lessons had prevented me from making the ride to work on it but there were about five of us that regularly came out here who also knew where the shovel was stashed. From the landing slope all the way up &nbsp;to the crown the ramp was devastated. It was all deep gouges turning up the soft soil underneath. &ldquo;If they are gonna ride on it, they should at least stomp it down&rdquo; Bing griped between winded huffs.I silently agreed and made a sour face. Older kids had been coming out at night with BMXs and an 80cc dirt bike. The BMX tracks weren&rsquo;t that noticeable but the dirt bike had left the ramp in an unusable state. They might as well have run a rototiller over it. I stepped off my bike and let it fall to the ground in disgust. I had been hoping to take a couple of slow runs and maybe catch a little air before doing any construction work. Bing shoved out his kickstand and stepped off. He rhythmically slammed his hightops into the soft earth while I fumed into the forest to retrieve the shovel.We kept the shovel up in a tree. It had been Bing&rsquo;s idea. I would never tell him I thought so, but he could be pretty clever when he tried.Shovel Tree was a little way past the Party Pit, an open area surrounded by trees. &nbsp;This clearing was regularly used by older kids for the kind of illicit late night parties where someone would mess up a ramp - so the shovel had to be hidden far enough from those jerks that it wasn&rsquo;t likely to be seen. The tree we settled on was down nearer the river and had lost a branch about 15 feet up its trunk. The bony remnant sticking out from the tree was a perfect place to hang a shovel handle. The lower branches stuck out in such a way that you could really only see the shovel hanging there when you were right underneath it. To hide or retrieve the thing required a daring leap from a nearby stump. You climbed up the stump, maybe a little more than waist height from the ground, jumped toward Shovel Tree, and either plucked or hung it all in one continuous motion. You then had the option of trying to hang on to the shovel, dragging it with you while avoiding the lower branches, or tossing it over your shoulder and hoping it didn&rsquo;t slice the back of your neck on the way down. I had seen both methods attempted successfully and unsuccessfully, but I never saw anyone get hurt. At least not badly enough that it would require telling a parent what had happened. I usually opted for the &lsquo;carry the shovel down with you&rsquo; method, since that always seemed the least likely to result in a head wound. It might have been a clever way of hiding the shovel but, because it was a Bing solution, that meant a higher than average risk of injury.I snagged the shovel off of Shovel Tree and started back through the clearing. Bing was standing there nudging his toe against a discarded beer can. He looked up at me.&ldquo;Listen man, we don&rsquo;t have to work on this today. We can head back into town. Find something else to do. We cou-&rdquo;&ldquo;No!&rdquo; I surprised myself with how loud I yelled at him. Surprised him too. We bickered, even tore into each other from time to time, but always as friends. I had crossed a line.We just sort of stared at each other for a moment, feeling the waves of what was going on wash over us. Finally, he curled his lip, flatly said &ldquo;dick&rdquo;, and stomped out of the clearing to go sit in the dirt beside the Kuwahara.I had been in a sour mood since I picked him up at his house. I saw the boxes packed in the garage. It hadn&rsquo;t really occurred to me that Bing might be feeling the same way. It was his family that was moving. His life that was getting lifted up and drifted across the country. I would still have my other friends here. Where they had always been. I was losing my best friend but he was losing everyone. I didn&rsquo;t say that to him of course. I just started digging and slapping down dirt. Swinging line drives with the flat of the shovel against the ruined side of our ramp. Our ramp. Mine and Bing&rsquo;s ramp. Other kids worked on it too, but it was just us two who had started it. I rammed the shovel down hard into the center of the trench. I was angry at the dirt. I was angry at Bing. I was angry at Bing&rsquo;s dad for getting a better job. I was angry at the kids who tore up our ramp. I was angry at the increasingly unbearable heat of the day. I was angry at me. I really didn't know what I was angry at. I stabbed the shovel as deeply as could.The next thing I knew, I was laying belly down beside the hole holding my chin where it had bounced off the shovel handle.I looked up to see Bing standing over me. My face was probably a mix of astonished and accusing, but Bing just stared right past me at the hole, eyes like pie plates.&ldquo;What in the hell, man?&rdquo; Bing blurted out, less to me, and more to the shovel as he reached down to take hold of it. It took a couple of firm yanks to dislodge the shovel. Whatever it had sunk into made a strange rattling, sucking sound. Like a reverse burp. I stood back up shoulder to shoulder with Bing, earlier animosities abandoned. Just like that, we had reset, united in our bewilderment.&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; I probed.&ldquo;Umm. Maybe like a crack or cave or something? Maybe you punched through into a cave?&rdquo;Neither of us believed that. Neither of us had ever seen a cave in the middle of a broad, flat, prairie. When Bing had hauled the shovel up bits of powdery wood had come up with it. Old dessicated fibers that had, at one time, been milled lumber. The edges were too clean and regular to be tree roots or buried deadfall. &ldquo;What about the wood?&rdquo; I was already piecing together a picture in my mind of what I had &ldquo;punched through&rdquo; so I floated out questions to see if Bing was thinking along the same lines. I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to voice what I was thinking.&ldquo;Why would someone bury a wood box by the river?&rdquo; Bing asked, walking the assumption forward to include not just wood, but a wooden box. He mirrored my tone and I could see dread ripple across his expression, before replacing it with a nervous grin. &ldquo;Is this a casket? Did you just jam a shovel into some dead guy&rsquo;s casket?&rdquo; Bing&rsquo;s smile widened into a full toothed display. &ldquo;Gross!&rdquo;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that. We don&rsquo;t know what it is!&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t help it. I was grinning now too. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably just old wood someone tossed out. And buried. On purpose. Beside the river.&rdquo;We traded conspiratorial looks but neither of us budged.&ldquo;Go check.&rdquo;&ldquo;You go check.&rdquo;&ldquo;You found it&rdquo;&ldquo;You have the shovel.&rdquo;We both took a step forward and arched over the hole. Bing used the tip of the shovel to &nbsp;begin a ginger excavation, careful and tense. Neither of us wanted to uncover anything grizzly, but then again, we absolutely wanted to uncover something grizzly. Something valuable. Something amazing.My heart was beating so hard my hands shook with each pulse. Light glinted off something metallic a few inches below the soil and my whole body lurched. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s treasure!&rdquo; The words exploded from my throat.Bing stopped clearing dirt and squinted at me. He feigned excited endorsement but sarcasm dripped from every word. &ldquo;Do you think pirates put it here? Sailed it up the river?&rdquo; Then he tagged his comment with our favored insult to really make sure it stuck. &ldquo;Child.&rdquo;&ldquo;Shut up. It&rsquo;s something shiny. There&rsquo;s something metal down there. It&rsquo;s metal in a box&rdquo;If Bing had any intention of spending more time poking fun at me, his curiosity overcame it. We crouched down, relatively sure that we weren&rsquo;t going to be nose to nose with a mummified corpse.Enough dirt had been cleared away that we could start to make out the shape of what we had found. The sun had been climbing in the sky and was almost directly above now, more clearly revealing the shapes below us. Squatting to take a lower angle, I could make out a rounded metal edge. Maybe a large plate, or disc almost filling a box about two feet square. Bing reached in, taking hold of the metal, and just as quickly dropped it, recoiling his hand.&ldquo;What! What happened?&rdquo; I demanded.&ldquo;Damn it! That&rsquo;s cold!&rdquo; he had his finger tips tucked under his armpit and rocked back and forth in wincing pain. He pulled out his fingers and looked at them. They seemed fine. No visible wounds or bleeding. He shook his hand aggressively in front of his bared teeth like a fan made of sausages. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yeah, fine. Damn it, that is ice cold. It feels like burning, but cold, man.&rdquo;I wrapped my hand in the belly of my T-shirt and stretched it down to slowly touch the metal. Nothing. It felt hard and maybe a little cool, but nothing like what Bing was on about.&ldquo;It feels normal. Just like metal. Are you messing with me?&rdquo;&ldquo;No. It was like frostbite, man. Still hurts a little.&rdquo;I took my hand out of my shirt and tentatively brushed a fingertip across the metal. Then all my fingers. Then the flat of my hand. A little cool, hard, metallic. Certainly not burning cold or frostbite cold. I reached my fingers down under the edge and grabbed hold. The plate was incredibly thin, like foil, but solid and unyielding. I pressed hard with my fingertips but the metal didn&rsquo;t bend or crumple. Although paper thin, the edge felt round and smooth, not sharp. I started lifting the circle of metal and found it so light that it didn&rsquo;t seem to have any substance at all. It took some twisting and wrangling to pull it from the box, since the hole we had cut wasn&rsquo;t quite large enough.I set the disk on the ground between us, now fully visible under the full midday sun. We didn&rsquo;t move. We didn&rsquo;t breath. The only sounds were leaves twisting in a light breeze and the distant buzz of insects. It was treasure. It was beautiful and frightening and impossible. Around the circular rim of the thing was metal, sure enough. A dull silvery metal with lines and markings along its circumference. Like a clock face, but with the minute marks set to irregular periods and angles. An interesting and unusual example of manufactured metal work. That part of the object I could wrap my mind around. What sat in the center of the ring was different. It was black. Just black. No reflections, no variation in the surface, no shadows. Light didn&rsquo;t play off it. Encircled by a band of paper thin metal, there on the ground sat nothing. Nothing at all. I felt my hand reaching before I had fully considered what I was doing. The middle finger of my left hand barely alighting on the black in the center of the disc. Just as unconsciously, I recoiled. The freezing, burning, cold was a shock.&ldquo;Cold, right?&rdquo; Bing spouted gleefully.I let out a cartoonishly long &ldquo;ooowwwww!&rdquo; that ended in wide smile. &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s like liquid or something. My fingers sunk right into it.&rdquo; He mimed the wide grip he had used to try to pick the disc up. &ldquo;What do you think it is?&rdquo;&ldquo;No clue. Like a part off some old machine or something. How long do you think it was buried?&rdquo; I rubbed at my fingertip until the feeling returned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s well up past the water line, and the ground around it is pretty dry. It had to be down there a long time for the wood to be so rotten.&rdquo; Bing shrugged and slowly shook his head. &ldquo;Hundred years maybe? I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; &ldquo;A hundred years? That&rsquo;s like, really old. Like pioneer old.&rdquo; I stood up and snagged the shovel off the ground where Bing had dumped it.&ldquo;What are you going to do with that?&rdquo;&ldquo;Just checking something.&rdquo;I hovered the blade of the shovel over the center of that black circle. No reflection. I could see the shadow cast from the shovel run over Bing&rsquo;s sneaker, across the ground, onto the metal ring, and just sort of end at the black. Cautiously I lowered the shovel until the tip just touched the black surface, or at least I thought it did. It was almost impossible to tell. All the visual feedback I had come to expect sort of didn&rsquo;t exist here, and I could feel my eyes struggling to find a point to focus on. I braced myself, expecting that same cold bite to crawl it&rsquo;s way up the shovel and into my bare hands. It didn&rsquo;t. Instead I felt a soft resistance, like the skin of a dried pudding cup. A small amount of downward pressure and I could see the blade of the shovel slip out of existence.Bing must have been holding his breath because he exhaled with a long whistle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so weird.&rdquo;&ldquo;Yeah&rdquo; I agreed. &ldquo;Feels kind of thick. Like stirring gravy or something.&rdquo; I pulled the shovel back up to check that it was still intact. It seemed okay. Even the clumps of dirt stuck along the edges seemed unperturbed. &ldquo;How deep do you think it is?&rdquo;I offered the handle to Bing. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Check it out.&rdquo;Bing proceeded to plunge the shovel until it was halfway submerged in the center of the black circle.&ldquo;Is that it?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yeah. Seems like.&rdquo; He bobbed the shovel a couple of times, each time stopping at the same spot along the handle. &ldquo;It hit something.&rdquo;He drove it down a little harder and I could hear a muffled, distant, thunk. The shovel was maybe a foot and a half deep. A foot and a half gone, as far as we could tell. Bing moved to lift the shovel back up.I waved my hands at him. &ldquo;Just wait. Just wait. I want to try something.&rdquo;I crouched down and carefully took hold of the metal ring. My finger still tingled a bit where I had touched the black, so I kept them well back from the inner edge. Just like before, I lifted the disc and was surprised at how little it weighed. There was almost nothing to it, like a rigid piece of tissue paper, but the breeze didn&rsquo;t seem to affect it at all. &ldquo;Are you still holding the shovel down? Like all the way down?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yeah, It&rsquo;s just sitting there. I&rsquo;m not even pushing it. It&rsquo;s just resting on the ground, or whatever. The ground at the bottom of that hole thing.&rdquo;I got down low, almost resting my head in the dirt. Under the raised disc, I could see the ground, the shadow cast by the metal ring and the shovel handle. On the other side were Bing&rsquo;s high tops, patches of grass, and our ramp. Nothing else. No shovel handle, no shovel blade. I reached up with my right hand and pushed down on the shovel handle where Bing still had hold of it. It didn&rsquo;t budge. It was passing through the ring and resting on something I couldn&rsquo;t see. I waved the ring up and down a little. The exposed parts of the shovel stayed put. &ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re right. It&rsquo;s like a hole or something, but you can move it around. It&rsquo;s so cool! Scary, but cool.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t even try to keep the grin out of my voice.We spent the next couple hours poking at the thing and laughing. We dropped in rocks and pine cones and watched them slowly slip through the black surface to disappear from view, seemingly forever. We stabbed it with tree branches and drew them back out, chilled but unharmed. Bing tried to ring the bell off the Kuwahara with a stick while it was on the other side of the black, but we couldn&rsquo;t hear it very well. Just a whisper of dull metallic clanging. The experiment required getting his hands dangerously close to that nipping cold surface so he didn&rsquo;t try it for long. I moved the shovel around on the other side feeling for its limits. It seemed fairly small, I could probably have reached every part of the hollow on the other side if I sunk my arm up to the shoulder, but that would have been crazy.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m parched.&rdquo; Bing licked his lips and sighed, sitting down heavily on a clump of grass.&ldquo;Yeah. Me too. I have to get home for supper too.&rdquo; We had completely ignored thirst and hunger while we examined our find. Now that I had stopped for a moment I felt fatigue press down on me and we finally rested. Bing sprawled on the ground while I drooped limply over the shovel. &ldquo;What do we do with this thing?&rdquo;I imagined trying to carry it home on my bike and couldn&rsquo;t really figure a way to do it. The disc was light and strong but it was too large to tuck under an arm. Maybe Bing would attempt it but I wouldn&rsquo;t risk that black stuff touching my bare skin while I was trying to pedal.&ldquo;Somebody will see it if we try carrying it back into town. It&rsquo;s not the kind of thing that anyone would ignore.&rdquo; Bing offered, head cocked to the side, eyes squinting. &ldquo;Maybe we can hang it on the shovel?&rdquo;I swiftly laid the blade of the shovel flat in the black until I could hook the top edges under the ring and fish it up off the ground. The disc just dangled there off the shovel like I had plucked it from a carnival pond game. Bing reached out and gave a firm tug on the ring. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how or why that works, but it doesn&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;s going anywhere.&rdquo;We headed over to Shovel Tree and this time Bing made the leap to hang both the shovel and the disc. The glint of the metal ring might catch the eye of someone skulking around over here but even in the mildest of shadows the rest of the disc just disappeared. It would have to do until we could find some better place to keep the thing. On the way back to pick up our bikes we kicked as much dirt as we could into the rotten box. We couldn&rsquo;t fill it. We would have had to go back and get the shovel for that but we disguised the square corners of the box well enough that it would hopefully pass for just another pit dug to add to the bike ramp.We both took one slow pass at the jump before heading back into town.I didn&rsquo;t tell anyone what we had found. That night I didn&rsquo;t sleep for a second.One week later, Bing was gone. His mom and dad had been packing all summer, gathering the contents of their single story house into the garage and loading it into a rented box truck. One morning, the truck wasn&rsquo;t there. I rode my bike past the house. Like a snail shell you find along the shore, it still carried all of the evidence of life only now it was empty. Not just empty, hollow. I knew that they were leaving. I knew that they had wanted to move before school started. Bing and his sister would be going to a new school, in a new city. I suppose I just didn&rsquo;t expect him to be gone.A few days later I rode out to the forest alone and just sat there looking at the river and brushing off mosquitoes.For that whole week we tried not to talk at all about Bing moving. It helped that we were completely enthralled with The Hole. At some point during the week we started calling it &ldquo;The Hole&rdquo; and the moniker stuck. We moved it to a more remote part of the forest and tested anything we could think of. We had put sticks, rocks, bits of cloth, action figures. Anything we could find that we didn&rsquo;t mind losing went into The Hole. Bing dipped an old radio halfway into the black and it stopped playing almost instantly. It looked fine but the batteries had gone completely dead. We used a towel and an oven mitt in an attempt to press our hands through the viscous surface. It always ended with one of us vibrating on the ground, fingers shoved deep into our mouth or armpit to restore circulation while the other one pointed and laughed. We talked about telling someone about the hole. Our parents. Our friends. A science lab maybe. We didn&rsquo;t know of any labs in our town and we couldn&rsquo;t even agree on what sort of scientist would study this thing. Bing said that he should take it with him.He started in sheepishly, as if this was all coming to him now, but soon he was laying down words with a &nbsp;salesman's patter. &ldquo;There has to be somebody at the university that would know what to do with it. Maybe they can test it and find out how it works. Maybe we can sell it. The Hole is probably military or NASA tech. Maybe there is a reward. I should probably take it, you know, so we can get it checked out or something.&rdquo; &nbsp;The idea hadn&rsquo;t just occurred to him. Bing was a poor liar. He had been thinking about taking The Hole with him for a while.I could feel my jaw tighten involuntarily. I was barely aware of my hands curling to fists. When the loud, shrill &ldquo;NO!&rdquo; burst out of me it took a moment to register that I was the one yelling.In an instant we were locked in a clumsy wrestlers clinch. I was dimly aware of the disc of black between us at our feet. I caught Bing's eyes as they flicked down to The Hole and then back up to mine. We stared for a few short seconds until a puzzled look drifted across Bing. I would have to imagine that I looked equally confused. Bing spoke first.&ldquo;What are we doing?&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;&ldquo;This is stupid, right?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yeah. You&rsquo;re stupid.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t hold back the chuckle.We both pulled away and took a step back. Laughing was the only apology either of us would offer or accept. That was how it worked between best friends.Of course, Bing had taken The Hole. He had ridden back out after supper with an empty briefcase before it got packed up for the move. There was no way that the disc would have fit in a regular sized case but the metal ring was so incredibly thin that he must have been able to close it well enough to bike it back home. He had stowed it somewhere in the box truck before his parents could see it and they had taken it with them. Out of town and across the country. And I was out there, in the forest, sitting alone among the sounds of a late summer evening. Small birds singing to each other and buzzing, hissing insects gathering along the riverbank in clouds that danced in the gentle breeze. That&rsquo;s when I heard something different. A distant tapping, like drums being played underwater. There was a thunk and a tip, tip, tap, followed by a scraping sound that was so faint that I could barely detect it.I tried to follow the sounds by sweeping my head low to the ground and narrowing in on the source. I must have looked like snake tasting the air. Just outside the clearing and getting close to the ramp I got down and put my head right up against the ground. The sounds were coming from down there.After discovering one impossible thing in the forest I wasn&rsquo;t going to leave without fully investigating another.The evening light was starting to fade by the time I finally dug through to the second box. The first one had rotted almost to powder having been buried for such a long time. This one was mostly intact. It was built from the same roughly milled lumber but the wood still had some strength to it. I had to dig around the top until I made enough room for the lid to open. There were remnants of old leather and fiber straps that must have bound the whole box together but those hadn&rsquo;t held up the way the wood had. I wedged the tip of the shovel under the edge of the lid and used it as a lever to pry the lid off. The night was cooling but I was vibrating and sweating so hard there must have been steam rising off my back.The old wood sent up a squealing creak before finally cracking apart. The lid flipped back like the cover of a book before slamming down into the newly dug soil. There, strapped to the lid with wooden planks was an almost perfect duplicate of The Hole.The metal disc was sandwiched between the planks and the lid along two of the sides leaving the black in the center completely exposed. The nails driven through the planks were rough and square. Whoever strapped the Hole on here had tried to drive one of the nails through the metal disc but that nail hadn&rsquo;t gone all the way through to the lid because it was bent over and flattened into the wood.Laying in the bottom of the box was an assortment of rocks, pinecones, sticks, toy cars, and action figures. I lifted a Greedo from the box and turned it over in my hand. Two-tone green plastic in an ancient wooden box. This was my Greedo, the one that I had dropped through the other Hole. The Hole that Bing had taken with him. I dropped to my knees in the dirt and scrabbled for a sharp rock. I held my Greedo in one hand and tried desperately to steady my other hand. The tremors radiated through my entire body as I scraped two rough but readable letters into Greedo&rsquo;s chest. HI. If I had spoken them there would be no way I could have held back the tears.I dropped Greedo into the Hole and watched as it slowly sunk out of view. I hoisted the box lid, bulky but manageable, and sprinted to my bike. The wood made my ride home difficult but I could have carried five of them and still made it back. It was almost like carrying nothing at all. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tIs it over? No , of course not, but it is approaching proper short story length. Maybe 1000-1500 more words or so.&nbsp;We called it a forest. Really, it was a few hundred trees along the riverbank. Standing at just the right angle you could see clear through them. From the stubble field on one side to the ripening durum across the river. &nbsp;Surrounding the forest for as far as you could see was mile upon mile of sun blasted, wind swept prairie. A forest then, at least in contrast. By 10 am, the baking heat would be unbearable. The trees might not have been much, but they stood thick enough to provide a little shade.Bing was riding his Kuwahara. Chrome silver with black accents in liquid smooth powder coat. I had a rust spotted CCM bmx frame adorned with a mish mash of parts pulled from dead bikes. Bing&rsquo;s bike was the envy of all the local kids, but I prefered my frankenstein bike. It could hit a jump in just the right way. A smooth launch, a little give on the landings. The Kuwahara had footpegs, better hand brakes, and a brand new chain, but it felt a little too unforgiving. Antagonistic. It confronted the ground rather than rolling over it. Also, Bing was always on it.The sun hadn&rsquo;t really gotten going yet, so the air was still a little cool. Wet streams drifted to the corners of my eyes as my feet spun the pedals. We didn&rsquo;t talk, but I could hear Bing breathing hard off to my left. We hadn&rsquo;t really discussed it, but we both knew where we were headed. Since late spring we had been building a jump in the forest. Greg Stevens had swiped a shovel from his garden shed and left it out there last summer. He had some plan for digging a WW1 trench and camping in it. His shovel caper resulted in a pit about two feet deep and four feet across. He couldn&rsquo;t even lay in it without crunching up his legs. Greg decided not to bring the shovel back since his dad had blamed the neighbor and bought a new one. Now it was our primary jump construction tool, and the trench was our main excavation point.We would all take turns scooping up some dirt from the trench and adding to the jump. Over a couple of weeks, it had gone from a small, bump crowning the edge of a natural ditch, to a loose kicker a couple feet high. We had ridden over the Jump dozens, maybe hundreds of times, but only the center had packed down properly. The edges were still loose enough to catch an errant wheel ending your your run really quick. You might spin off to the side, dump the bike right there, or stop dead and go over the handlebars. Honestly it was hard to tell what might happen, except that it would probably be bad. We would bang on the jump with the shovel, or ride over it slowly, but without some rain to really tamp it down, it was just too scary to hit the jump properly, at full speed.I made it to the edge of the forest where our jump was under construction and locked up my brakes on the loose dirt. I leaned hard, kicking out my back tire, planting my inside foot and sliding to a tripod stop. Bing, right behind me, did the same, but maybe not with quite as much style.I gave the ramp a quick once over to see if any work had been done on it in the past couple of days. Swimming lessons had prevented me from coming out and working on it, but there were about five of us that regularly came out here, and also knew where the shovel was stashed. All I saw were deep gouges running up the landing slope of the ramp, turning up all the soft soil underneath. &ldquo;If they are gonna ride on it, they should at least stomp it down&rdquo; Bing griped between winded huffs.I silently agreed and made a sour face. Older kids had been coming out at night with BMXs, and an 80cc dirt bike. The BMX tracks weren&rsquo;t that noticeable, but the dirt bike had left the ramp in an unusable state. They might as well have run a rototiller over it. I stepped off my bike and let it fall to the ground in disgust. I had been hoping to take a couple of slow runs, maybe catch a little air, before doing any construction work. Bing shoved out his kickstand and stepped off. He started stamping his hightops into the soft earth while I fumed into the forest to retrieve the shovel.We kept the shovel up in a tree. It had been Bing&rsquo;s idea. I would never tell him I thought so, but he could be pretty clever when he tried.Shovel tree was a little way past the Party Pit, an open area surrounded by trees. &nbsp;This clearing was regularly used by older kids for the kind illicit late night parties where someone would mess up a ramp, so the shovel had to be hidden far enough from those jerks that it wasn&rsquo;t likely to be seen. The tree we settled on was down nearer the river and had lost a branch about 15 feet up it&rsquo;s trunk. The bony remnant sticking out from the tree was a perfect place to hang a shovel handle. The lower branches stuck out in such a way that you could really only see the shovel hanging there when you were right underneath it. To hide or retrieve the thing, required a daring leap from a nearby stump. You climbed up the stump, maybe a little more than waist height from the ground, jumped toward shovel tree, and either lifted or hung it all in one continuous motion. You then had the option of trying to hang on to the shovel dragging it with you while avoiding the lower branches, or tossing it over your shoulder and hoping it didn&rsquo;t slice the back of your neck on the way down. I had seen both methods attempted successfully and unsuccessfully, but I never saw anyone get hurt. At least not badly enough that it would require telling a parent what had happened. I usually opted for the &lsquo;carry the shovel down with you&rsquo; method, since that always seemed the least likely to end in a head wound. It might have been a clever way of hiding the shovel, but it was a Bing solution, so that meant a higher than average risk of injury.I plucked the shovel off of Shovel Tree and started back through the clearing. Bing was standing there nudging his toe against a discarded beer can. He looked up at me.&ldquo;Listen man, we don&rsquo;t have to work on this today. We can head back into town. Find something to do. We cou-&rdquo;&ldquo;No!&rdquo; I surprised myself with how loud I yelled at him. Surprised him too. We bickered, even tore into each other from time to time, but always as friends. I had crossed a line.We just sort of stared at each other for a moment, feeling the waves of what was going on wash over us. Finally, he curled his lip, flatly said &ldquo;dick&rdquo; and stomped out of the clearing to go sit in the dirt beside the Kuwahara.I had been in a sour mood since I picked him up at his house. I saw the boxes packed in the garage. It hadn&rsquo;t really occurred to me that Bing might be feeling the same way. It was his family that was moving. His life that was getting lifted up and drifted across the country. I would still have my other friends here, where they had always been. I was losing my best friend, but he was losing everyone. I didn&rsquo;t say that too him of course. I just started digging and slapping down dirt. Swinging line drives with the flat of the shovel against the ruined side of our ramp. Our ramp. Mine and Bing&rsquo;s ramp. Other kids worked on it too, but it was just us two who had started it. I rammed the shovel down hard into the center of the trench. I was angry at the dirt. I was angry at Bing. I was angry at Bing&rsquo;s dad for getting a better job. I was angry at the kids who tore up our ramp. I was angry at the increasingly unbearable heat of the day. I was angry at me. I really didn't know what I was angry at. I stabbed the shovel as deeply as could.The next thing I knew, I was laying belly down beside the hole holding my chin where it had bounced off the shovel handle.I looked up to see Bing standing over me. My face was probably a mix of bewildered and accusing, but Bing just stared right past me at the hole, eyes like pie plates.&ldquo;What in the hell, man?&rdquo; Bing blurted out, less to me, and more to the shovel, as he reached down to take hold of it. It took a couple of firm yanks to dislodge, and either the shovel, or whatever it had sunk into made a strange rattling, sucking sound. Like a reverse burp. I stood back up, shoulder to shoulder with Bing, earlier animosities abandoned. Just like that, we had reset, united in our bewilderment.&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; I probed.&ldquo;Umm. Maybe like a crack, or cave or something? Maybe you punched through into a cave?&rdquo;Neither of us believed that. Neither of us had ever seen a cave in the middle of a broad, flat, prairie. When Bing had hauled the shovel up bits of powdery wood had come up with it. Old dessicated fibers that had, at one time, been milled lumber. The edges were too clean and regular to be tree roots, or buried deadfall. &ldquo;What about the wood?&rdquo; I was already piecing together a picture in my mind of what I had &ldquo;punched through&rdquo; so I floated out questions to see if Bing was thinking along the same lines. I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to voice what I was thinking.&ldquo;Why would someone bury a wood box by the river?&rdquo; Bing asked, walking the assumption forward to include not just wood, but a wooden box. He mirrored my tone and I could see dread ripple across his expression, before replacing it with a nervous grin. &ldquo;Is this a casket? Did you just jam a shovel into some dead guy&rsquo;s casket?&rdquo; Bings smile widened into a full toothed display. &ldquo;Gross!&rdquo;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that. We don&rsquo;t know what it is!&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t help it. I was grinning now too. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably just old wood someone tossed out. And buried. On purpose. Beside the river.&rdquo;We traded conspiratorial looks, but neither of us budged.&ldquo;Go check.&rdquo;&ldquo;You go check.&rdquo;&ldquo;You found it&rdquo;&ldquo;You have the shovel.&rdquo;We both took a step forward and arched over the hole. Bing used the tip of the shovel to &nbsp;begin a ginger excavation, careful and tense. Neither of us wanted to uncover anything grizzly, but then again, we absolutely wanted to uncover something grizzly. Or, valuable, amazing.My heart was beating so hard my hands would shake with each pulse. When light glinted off something metallic a few inches below the soil, My whole body lurched. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s treasure!&rdquo;Bing stopped clearing dirt and squinted at me. &ldquo;Do you think pirates put it here? Sailed it up the river?&rdquo; He let sarcasm drip from every word. &ldquo;Child.&rdquo;&ldquo;Shut up. It&rsquo;s something shiny. There&rsquo;s something metal down there. It&rsquo;s metal in a box&rdquo;If Bing had any intention of spending more time poking fun at me, his curiosity overcame it. We crouched down, relatively sure that we weren&rsquo;t going to be nose to nose with a mummified corpse.Enough dirt had been cleared away that we could start to make out the shape of what we had found. The sun had been climbing in the sky and was almost directly above us now more clearly revealing the shapes below us. Taking a lower angle, I could make out a rounded metal edge. Maybe a large plate, or disc almost filling a box about two feet square. Bing reached in, taking hold of the metal, and just as quickly dropped it, recoiling his hand.&ldquo;What! What happened?&rdquo; I demanded.&ldquo;Damn it! That&rsquo;s cold!&rdquo; he had his finger tips tucked under his armpit and rocked back and forth in wincing pain. He pulled out his fingers and looked at them. They seemed fine. No visible wounds or bleeding. He shook his hand aggressively in front of his bared teeth like a fan made of sausages. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yeah, fine. Damn it, that is ice cold. It feels like burning, but cold, man.&rdquo;I wrapped my hand in the belly of my T-shirt and stretched it down to slowly touch the metal. Nothing. It felt hard and maybe a little cool, but nothing like what Bing had experienced.&ldquo;It feels normal. Just like metal. Are you messing with me?&rdquo;&ldquo;No. It was like frostbite, man. Still hurts a little.&rdquo;I took my hand out of my shirt and tentatively brushed a fingertip across the metal. Then all my fingers. Then the flat of my hand. A little cool, hard, metallic. Certainly not burning cold or frostbite cold. I reached my fingers down under the edge and grabbed hold. The plate was incredibly thin, like foil, but solid and unyielding. I pressed hard with my fingertips but the metal didn&rsquo;t bend or crumple. Although paper thin, the edge felt round and smooth, not sharp. I started lifting the circle of metal and found it so light that it didn&rsquo;t seem to have any substance at all. It took some twisting and wrangling to pull it from the box, since the hole we had cut wasn&rsquo;t quite large enough.I set the disk on the ground between us, now fully visible under the full midday sun. We didn&rsquo;t move. We didn&rsquo;t breath. The only sounds were leaves twisting in a light breeze, and the distant buzz of insects. It was treasure. It was beautiful and frightening and impossible. Around the circular rim of the thing was metal, sure enough. A dull silvery metal with lines and markings along its circumference. Like a clock face, but with the minute marks set to irregular periods and angles. Interesting and unusual, but it looked manufactured, something I could wrap my mind around. What sat in the center of the ring was different. It was black. Just black. No reflections, no variation in the surface, no shadows. Light didn&rsquo;t play off it. Encircled by a band of paper thin metal, there on the ground sat nothing. Nothing at all. I felt my hand reaching before I had fully considered what I was doing. The middle finger of my left hand barely alighting on the black in the center of the disc. Just as unconsciously, I recoiled. The freezing, burning, cold was a shock.&ldquo;Cold, right?&rdquo; Bing spouted gleefully.I let out a cartoonishly long &ldquo;ooowwwww!&rdquo; that ended in wide smile. &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s like liquid or something. My fingers sunk right into it.&rdquo; He mimed the wide grip he had used to try to pick the disc up. &ldquo;What do you think it is?&rdquo;&ldquo;No clue. Like a part off some old machine or something. How long do you think it was buried?&rdquo; I rubbed at my fingertip until the feeling returned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s well up past the water line, and the ground around it is pretty dry. It had to be down there a long time for the wood to be so rotten.&rdquo; Bing shrugged and slowly shook his head. &ldquo;Hundred years maybe? I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; &ldquo;A hundred years? That&rsquo;s like, really old. Like pioneer old.&rdquo; I stood up and snagged the shovel off the ground where Bing had dumped it.&ldquo;What are you going to do with that?&rdquo;&ldquo;Just checking something.&rdquo;I hovered the blade of the shovel over the center of that black circle. No reflection. I could see the shadow cast from the shovel run over Bing&rsquo;s sneaker, across the ground, onto the metal ring, and just sort of end at the black. Cautiously I lowered the shovel until the tip just touched the black surface, or at least I thought it did. It was almost impossible to tell. All the visual feedback I had come to expect sort of didn&rsquo;t exist here, and I could feel my eyes struggling to find a point to focus on. I braced myself, expecting that same cold bite to crawl it&rsquo;s way up the shovel and into my bare hands. It didn&rsquo;t. Instead I felt a soft resistance, like the skin of a dried pudding cup. A small amount of downward pressure and I could see the blade of the shovel slip out of existence.Bing must have been holding his breath because he exhaled with a long whistle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so weird.&rdquo;&ldquo;Yeah&rdquo; I agreed. &ldquo;Feels kind of thick. Like stirring gravy or something.&rdquo; I pulled the shovel back up to check that it was still intact. It seemed okay. Even the clumps of dirt stuck along the edges seemed unperturbed. &ldquo;How deep do you think it is?&rdquo;I offered the handle to Bing. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Check it out.&rdquo;Bing proceeded to plunge the shovel until it was about halfway disappeared into the black circle.&ldquo;Is that it?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yeah. Seems like.&rdquo; He bobbed the shovel a couple of times, each time stopping at the same spot along the handle. &ldquo; It hit something.&rdquo;He drove it down a little harder and I could hear a muffled, distant, thunk. The shovel was maybe a foot and a half deep. A foot and a half gone, as far as we could tell. Bing moved to lift the shovel back up.I waved my hands at him. &ldquo;Just wait. Just wait. I want to try something.&rdquo;I crouched down and carefully took hold of the metal ring. My finger still tingled a bit where I had touched the black, so I kept them well back from the inner edge. Just like before, I lifted the disc and was surprised at how little it weighed. There was almost nothing to it, like a rigid piece of tissue paper, but the breeze didn&rsquo;t seem to affect it at all. &ldquo;Are you still holding the shovel down? Like all the way down?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yeah, It&rsquo;s just sitting there. I&rsquo;m not even pushing it. It&rsquo;s just resting on the ground, or whatever. The ground at the bottom of that hole thing.&rdquo;I got down low, almost resting my head in the dirt. Under the raised disc, I could see the ground, the shadow cast by the metal ring and the shovel handle. On the other side were Bing&rsquo;s high tops, patches of grass, and our ramp. Nothing else. No shovel handle, no shovel blade. I reached up with my right hand and pushed down on the shovel handle where Bing still had hold of it. It didn&rsquo;t budge. It was passing through the ring and resting on something I couldn&rsquo;t see. I waved the ring up and down a little. The exposed parts of the shovel stayed put. &ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re right. It&rsquo;s like a hole or something, but you can move it around. It&rsquo;s so cool! Scary, but cool.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t even try to keep the grin out of my voice.We spent the next couple hours poking at the thing and laughing. We dropped in rocks and pine cones and watched them slowly slip through the black surface to disappear from view, seemingly forever. We stabbed it with tree branches and drew them back out, chilled but unharmed. Bing tried to ring the bell off the Kuwahara with a stick while it was on the other side of the black, but we couldn&rsquo;t hear it very well. Just a whisper of dull metallic clanging. The experiment required getting his hands dangerously close to that nipping cold surface, so he didn&rsquo;t try it for long. I moved the shovel around on the other side feeling for it&rsquo;s limits. It seemed fairly small, I could probably have reached every part of the hollow on the other side if I sunk my arm up to the shoulder, but that would have been crazy.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m parched.&rdquo; Bing licked his lips and sighed, sitting down heavily on a clump of grass.&ldquo;Yeah. Me too. I have to get home for supper too.&rdquo; We had completely ignored thirst and hunger while we examined our find, but now that I had stopped for a second I felt fatigue press down on me powerfully. I rested, drooped over the shovel. &ldquo;What do we do with this thing?&rdquo;I imagined trying to carry it home on my bike and couldn&rsquo;t really figure a way to do it. The disc was light and strong, but it was too large to tuck under an arm. Maybe Bing would attempt it, but I wouldn&rsquo;t risk that black stuff touching my bare skin while I was trying to pedal.&ldquo;Somebody will see it if we try carrying it back into town. It&rsquo;s not the kind of thing that anyone would ignore.&rdquo; Bing offered, head cocked to the side, eyes squinting. &ldquo;Maybe we can hang it on the shovel?&rdquo;I followed his lead and swiftly laid the blade of the shovel flat in the black until I could hook the top edges under the ring and fish it up off the ground. The disc just dangled there, off the shovel, like I had plucked it from a carnival pond game. Bing reached out and gave a firm tug on the ring. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how or why that works, but it doesn&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;s going anywhere.&rdquo;We headed over to shovel tree, where Bing made the leap to hang the shovel and disc. The glint of the metal ring might catch the eye of someone skulking around over here, but even in the mildest of shadows the rest of the disc just disappeared. It would have to do until we could find some better place to keep the thing. On the way back to pick up our bikes, we kicked as much dirt as we could into the rotten box. We couldn&rsquo;t fill it. We would have had to go back and get the shovel for that, but we disguised the square corners of the box well enough that it would probably pass for just another ramp building pit.We both took one slow pass at the jump, before heading back into town.\t\t"

Maybe someday soon it will be finished, but that day isn't today, so fair warning; this story is not finished, and if you hate cliffhangers, maybe skip this one.&nbsp;We called it a forest. Really, it was a few hundred trees along the riverbank. Standing at just the right angle you could see clear through them.

Maybe like a crack, or cave or something? Maybe you punched through into a cave?&rdquo;Neither of us believed that. Neither of us had ever seen a cave in the middle of a broad, flat, prairie. When Bing had hauled the shovel up bits of powdery wood had come up with it. Old dessicated fibers that had, at one time, been milled lumber. The edges were too clean and regular to be tree roots, or buried deadfall. &ldquo;What about the wood?&rdquo; I was already piecing together a picture in my mind of what I had &ldquo;punched through&rdquo; so I floated out questions to see if Bing was thinking along the same lines. I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to voice what I was thinking.&ldquo;Why would someone bury a wood box by the river?&rdquo; Bing asked, walking the assumption forward to include not just wood, but a wooden box. He mirrored my tone and I could see dread ripple across his expression, before replacing it with a nervous grin. &ldquo;Is this a casket? Did you just jam a shovel into some dead guy&rsquo;s casket?&rdquo; Bings smile widened into a full toothed display. &ldquo;Gross!&rdquo;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that. We don&rsquo;t know what it is!&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t help it. I was grinning now too. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably just old wood someone tossed out. And buried. On purpose. Beside the river.&rdquo;We traded conspiratorial looks, but neither of us budged.&ldquo;Go check.&rdquo;&ldquo;You go check.&rdquo;&ldquo;You found it&rdquo;&ldquo;You have the shovel.&rdquo;We both took a step forward and arched over the hole. Bing used the tip of the shovel to &nbsp;begin a ginger excavation, careful and tense. Neither of us wanted to uncover anything grizzly, but then again, we absolutely wanted to uncover something grizzly. Or, valuable, amazing.My heart was beating so hard my hands would shake with each pulse. When light glinted off something metallic a few inches below the soil, My whole body lurched. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s treasure!&rdquo;Bing stopped clearing dirt and squinted at me. &ldquo;Do you think pirates put it here?&rdquo; He let sarcasm drip from every word. &ldquo;Child.&rdquo;&ldquo;Shut up. It&rsquo;s something shiny. There&rsquo;s something metal down there. It&rsquo;s metal in a box&rdquo;If Bing had any intention of spending more time making fun of me, his curiosity overcame it. We crouched down, relatively sure that we weren&rsquo;t going to be nose to nose with a mummified corpse.Enough dirt had been cleared away that we could start to make out the shape of what we had found. The sun had been climbing in the sky and was almost directly above us now more clearly revealing the shapes below us. Taking a lower angle, I could make out a rounded metal edge. Maybe a large plate, or disc almost filling a box about two feet square. Bing reached in, taking hold of the metal, and just as quickly dropped it, recoiling his hand.&ldquo;What! What happened?&rdquo; I demanded.&ldquo;Damn it! That&rsquo;s cold!&rdquo; he had his finger tips tucked under his armpit and rocked back and forth in wincing pain. He pulled out his fingers and looked at them. They seemed fine. No visible wounds or bleeding. He shook his hand aggressively in front of his face like a fan made of sausages. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yeah, fine. Damn it, that is ice cold. It feels like burning, but cold, man.&rdquo;I wrapped my hand in the belly of my T-shirt and stretched it down to slowly touch the metal. Nothing. It felt hard and maybe a little cool, but nothing like what Bing had experienced.&ldquo;It feels normal. Just like metal. Are you messing with me?&rdquo;&ldquo;No. It was like frostbite, man. Still hurts a little.&rdquo;I took my hand out of my shirt and tentatively brushed a fingertip across the metal. Then all my fingers. Then the flat of my hand. A little cool, hard, metallic. Certainly not burning cold or frostbite cold. I reached my fingers down under the edge and grabbed hold. The plate was incredibly thin, like foil, but solid and unyielding. I pressed hard with my fingertips but the metal didn&rsquo;t bend or crumple. Although paper thin, the edge felt round and smooth, not sharp. I started lifting the circle of metal and found it so light that it didn&rsquo;t seem to have any substance at all. It took some twisting and wrangling to pull it from the box, since the hole we had cut wasn&rsquo;t quite large enough.I set the disk on the ground between us, now fully visible under the full midday sun. We didn&rsquo;t move. We didn&rsquo;t breath. The only sounds were leaves twisting in a light breeze, and the distant buzz of insects. It was treasure. It was beautiful and frightening and impossible. Around the circular rim of the thing was metal, sure enough. A dull silvery metal with lines and markings along its circumference. Like a clock face, but with the minute marks set to irregular periods and angles. Interesting and unusual, but it looked manufactured, something I could wrap my mind around. What sat in the center of the ring was different. It was black. Just black. No reflections, no variation in the surface, no shadows. Light didn&rsquo;t play off it at all. Encircled by a band of paper thin metal, there on the ground sat nothing. Nothing at all. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tContinuing&nbsp;what I was working on last week, I have posted the newest revision of this short story. There are some edits and improvements to the start, and another page or so of additional story. It still doesn't have an ending. Actually it does, but I haven't written all the stuff between what you see here and the last couple paragraphs, so leaving it hanging makes more dramatic sense. If you wanted to wait until I finish the whole thing to read it, that would probably be a good idea. I'll just keep posting it this way until it's all done, which should be in 1 or 2 weeks.&nbsp;We called it a forest. Really, it was a few hundred trees along the riverbank. Standing at just the right angle you could see clear through them. From the stubble field on one side to the ripening durum across the river. &nbsp;Surrounding the forest for as far as you could see was mile upon mile of sun blasted, wind swept prairie. A forest then, at least in contrast. By 10 am, the baking heat would be unbearable. The trees might not have been much, but they stood thick enough to provide a little shade.Bing was riding his Kuwahara. Chrome silver with black accents in liquid smooth powder coat. I had a rust spotted CCM bmx frame adorned with a mish mash of parts pulled from dead bikes. Bing&rsquo;s bike was the envy of all the local kids, but I prefered my frankenstein bike. It could hit a jump in just the right way. A smooth launch, a little give on the landings. The Kuwahara had footpegs, better hand brakes, and a brand new chain, but it felt a little too unforgiving. Antagonistic. It confronted the ground rather than rolling over it. Also, Bing was always on it.The sun hadn&rsquo;t really gotten going yet, so the air was still a little cool. Wet streams drifted to the corners of my eyes as my feet spun the pedals. We didn&rsquo;t talk, but I could hear Bing breathing hard off to my left. We hadn&rsquo;t really discussed it, but we both knew where we were headed. Since late spring we had been building a jump in the forest. Greg Stevens had swiped a shovel from his garden shed and left it out there last summer. He had some plan for digging a WW1 trench and camping in it. His shovel caper resulted in a pit about two feet deep and four feet across. He couldn&rsquo;t even lay in it without crunching up his legs. Greg decided not to bring the shovel back since his dad had blamed the neighbor and bought a new one. Now it was our primary jump construction tool, and the trench was our main excavation point.We would all take turns scooping up some dirt from the trench and adding to the jump. Over a couple of weeks, it had gone from a small, bump crowning the edge of a natural ditch, to a loose kicker a couple feet high. We had ridden over the Jump dozens, maybe hundreds of times, but only the center had packed down properly. The edges were still loose enough to catch an errant wheel ending your your run really quick. You might spin off to the side, dump the bike right there, or stop dead and go over the handlebars. Honestly it was hard to tell what might happen, except that it would probably be bad. We would bang on the jump with the shovel, or ride over it slowly, but without some rain to really tamp it down, it was just too scary to hit the jump properly, at full speed.I made it to the edge of the forest where our jump was under construction and locked up my brakes on the loose dirt. I leaned hard, kicking out my back tire, planting my inside foot and sliding to a tripod stop. Bing, right behind me, did the same, but maybe not with quite as much style.I gave the ramp a quick once over to see if any work had been done on it in the past couple of days. Swimming lessons had prevented me from coming out and working on it, but there were about five of us that regularly came out here, and also knew where the shovel was stashed. All I saw were deep gouges running up the landing slope of the ramp, turning up all the soft soil underneath. &ldquo;If they are gonna ride on it, they should at least stomp it down&rdquo; Bing griped between winded huffs.I silently agreed and made a sour face. Older kids had been coming out at night with BMXs, and an 80cc dirt bike. The BMX tracks weren&rsquo;t that noticeable, but the dirt bike had left the ramp in an unusable state. They might as well have run a rototiller over it. I stepped off my bike and let it fall to the ground in disgust. I had been hoping to take a couple of slow runs, maybe catch a little air, before doing any construction work. Bing shoved out his kickstand and stepped off. He started stamping his hightops into the soft earth while I fumed into the forest to retrieve the shovel.We kept the shovel up in a tree. It had been Bing&rsquo;s idea. I would never tell him I thought so, but he could be pretty clever when he tried.Shovel Tree was a little way past the Party Pit, an open area surrounded by trees. &nbsp;This clearing was regularly used by older kids for the kind illicit late night parties where someone would mess up a ramp, so the shovel had to be hidden far enough from those jerks that it wasn&rsquo;t likely to be seen. The tree we settled on had lost a branch about 15 feet up it&rsquo;s trunk. The bony remnant sticking out from the tree was just enough to hang the shovel handle. The lower branches stuck out in such a way that you could really only see the shovel hanging there when you were right underneath it. To hide or retrieve the thing, required a daring leap from a nearby stump. You climbed up the stump, maybe a little more than waist height from the ground, jumped toward Shovel Tree, and either lifted or hung it all in one continuous motion. You then had the option of trying to hang on to the shovel dragging it with you while avoiding the lower branches, or tossing it over your shoulder and hoping it didn&rsquo;t slice the back of your neck on the way down. I had seen both methods attempted successfully and unsuccessfully, but I never saw anyone get hurt. At least not badly enough that it would require telling a parent what had happened. I usually opted for the &lsquo;carry the shovel down with you&rsquo; method, since that always seemed the least likely to end in a head wound. It might have been a clever way of hiding the shovel, but it was a Bing solution, so that meant a higher than average risk of injury.I plucked the shovel off of Shovel Tree and started back through the clearing. Bing was standing there nudging his toe against a discarded beer can. He looked up at me.&ldquo;Listen man, we don&rsquo;t have to work on this today. We can head back into town. Find something to do. We cou-&rdquo;&ldquo;No!&rdquo; I surprised myself with how loud I yelled at him. Surprised him too. As friends do, we bickered, even tore into each other from time to time, but I had crossed a line.We just sort of stared at each other for a moment, feeling the waves of what was going on wash over us. Finally, he curled his lip, flatly said &ldquo;dick&rdquo; and stomped out of the clearing to go sit in the dirt beside the Kuwahara.Of course I know now that he had been just as upset as me. Probably more. It was his family that was moving. His life that was getting lifted up and drifted across the country. I would still have my other friends here, where they had always been. I was losing my best friend, but he was losing everyone. Like I said, I know that now. Back then, I just started digging and slapping down dirt. Swinging line drives with the flat of the shovel against the ruined side of our ramp. Our ramp. Mine and Bing&rsquo;s ramp. Other kids worked on it too, but it was just us two who had started it.I rammed the shovel down hard into the center of the trench. I was angry at the dirt. I was angry at the increasingly unbearable heat of the day. I was angry at Bing. I was angry at Bing&rsquo;s dad for getting a better job. I was angry at me. I was angry at the kids who tore up our ramp. I really didn't know what I was angry at. I stabbed the shovel as deeply as could.The next thing I knew, I was laying belly down beside the hole holding my chin where it had bounced off the shovel handle.I looked up to see Bing standing over me. My face was probably a mix of bewildered and accusing, but Bing just stared right past me at the hole, eyes like pie plates.&ldquo;What in the hell, man?&rdquo; Bing blurted out, less to me, and more to the shovel, as he reached down to take hold of it. It took a couple of firm yanks to dislodge it, and either the shovel, or whatever it had sunk into made a strange rattling, sucking sound. Like a reverse burp.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI&rsquo;m sure there is a name for people like me. The people who don&rsquo;t watch movies when they are new, don&rsquo;t read books when they come out, don&rsquo;t binge that show the first weekend, and don&rsquo;t play games in the first month. I could blame it on having kids, but honestly, I was pretty far down this path before they came along. I just like to wait a little.I get excited by trailers and hype pieces like any fan. I search out interviews with creators, and eat up behind the scenes clips. I just don&rsquo;t buy much, especially games, on the first day. I certainly have in the past. There were games that I bought at retail on launch day. I don&rsquo;t feel like I really regret any of those purchases, but I know that it probably would have been better to wait.Games aren&rsquo;t really like a lot of other artistic mediums. There is that quote attributed to da Vinci that goes &ldquo;art is never finished, only abandoned&rdquo;. What if your art was not only never finished, but you could dabble on the canvas months or years after it was sold and installed in the customers home. Imagine now that you could make those changes from, and too, anywhere in the world. That art now has the potential to never be finished. People could enjoy that art over and over again as new changes and additions are presented to them. They could even be encouraged to pay for that art again to see more of it. They could be persuaded to subscribe to that art, continually paying and continually receiving. This is where games have diverged from our historical understanding of art. Art as an object or experience that can be bought or sold. Frankly, we haven&rsquo;t got a damn clue how to promote art like that. We don&rsquo;t know how to advertise it. We don&rsquo;t know how to market it. Does the big expensive launch even make sense anymore?I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a unique case. I think that more and more people are waiting and choosing the art they want to engage with when they want to engage with it. Not just when it becomes available. Not when the advertisements are out in full force. The rise of streaming and subscription services isn't just due to availability. It's the way people want their art delivered to them. On their own schedule.With games there is an even more practical reason for waiting. Games get better after the initial launch. Bugs get fixed. Features get added. Issues get resolved. This doesn't happen with music or movies. There is no patch coming to The Beatles Revolver. That album came out, and other than being transferred to new delivery mediums, it remains unchanged. Video Games are sprawling software systems, and most of them currently can communicate over the Internet. They can be modified, and  improved over time. This wasn't always the case in the past, but that is the way it works now. The way that video games work has changed. The way the are advertised and sold should probably change with it.As someone who is endeavoring to make and sell games, maybe it would be best for me if people got revved up for new releases and bought them right when they are put on offer. Maybe that is the best way to make money. There is value in knowing when a ship has sailed. The big marketing push is near its end. Now would be a good time to explore the consistent low level hum. Marketing as gentle reminder.I'm a terrible salesman. I don't really know how any of this is supposed to work, but I think that games can have a much longer life than they currently enjoy. I think, with my limited ability, extending that life is what I will try to do. Other people wait too. It's not a matter of telling them to buy now, it's more about reminding them your game exists when they are ready to make a purchase.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games : 1000 Miglia : Great 1000 Miles Rally and World Rally ChampionshipDesign, at it&rsquo;s best, solves problems. In the early 90s videogames had a lot of problems to solve, most of them technical. Drawing pixel to a screen quickly was tricky enough. Making those pixels look like anything more than digital mud was a rare success. Getting the images on screen to react to input in a satisfying way must have been some form of magic.So, in the early 90s, when faced with the problem of creating an intense rally racing game based on an italian test of human and automotive endurance that had not been run in decades, what do you do?The first thing you do is steal.Drawing a three dimensional track was unattainable on the computer hardware available. The physics routines capable of simulating a convincing car had not been written. Color palettes were limited and animation was limited. Add to that the restrictions of the JAMMA hardware standard that allow game circuit boards to be swapped between similar cabinets, meaning that you might be playing a racing game with buttons and a joystick. Creating a game that evokes the feeling of intense, edge of control racing seems like a tough design problem.Luckily a year previous, the game World Rally Championship was released by a competing studio. Maybe the makers of 1000 Miglia licensed the technology, or maybe they just plain old lifted every gameplay element of World Rally Championship. Whatever the case, they took an idea and ran with it. Both games solve the problem of presenting a slightly canted overhead view of a race by doing the opposite of what conventional wisdom would advise. Rather than pulling the view back to show more of the track, giving the player the opportunity to react to upcoming turns and obstacles, both of these games are very tightly focused on the car and the parts of the track immediately surrounding it. By pushing the view in rather than pulling back, the sense of speed and impending danger is intensified. Of course, restricting the players view of the track would be inexcusable in a racing game, if some other solution wasn&rsquo;t presented. Both World Rally and 1000 Miglia will briefly flash curving arrows on the screen, like a rally co-driver shouting out upcoming turns and chicanes. Added to that, each leg of the race is only 60 seconds long. For one unblinking, white knuckle minute you have to pay precise attention to upcoming turns, and precisely navigate them, usually by sliding all over the place.What World Rally started 1000 Miglia polishes to a high sheen. Where there were muddy indistinct graphics, they are replaced by sharp, colorful, representations of italian &nbsp;streets and roads where cartoon blurs and speed lines enhance your sense of movement. In place of a generic rally car, 1000 Miglia offers an array of classic supercars from the 1930 to the 1950s. The stock engine noises of World Rally are gone, and instead you will hear the whine and grind of old gearboxes with less than precise tolerances. These cars belch fire and roar from unmuffled exhaust pipes. There is no expectation of traction or modern vehicle handling. Every car in this lineup is a squirrely death box pushed past its limits. This is the sort of fantasy that video games excel at. Maybe the control and mechanics design problems were solved by World Rally, but it what 1000 Miglia that also solved the presentation and immersion problems. Excellent design, from the bottom to the top.       \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tIt&rsquo;s all about the cogs. All of the internal workings. These digital tools that I use must be considered, and employed from the inside out. Like building a table, though you see less of them, it&rsquo;s most important that the legs are built correctly. The surface can be changed or embellished, but bad legs make for wobbly tables. As someone who is usually preoccupied with how an object in a game or video will ultimately look, having to worry more about the bones and the core construction can sometimes suck. That is, it sucks time away from simply focusing on the external aesthetics.I have heard or read many pieces of advice for artists. There are those who say that you should dedicate yourself completely to one aspect, one field, one avenue of study. If you would like to work on costume design, you shouldn&rsquo;t distract yourself with the technicalities of animation. If you want to work on illustration, you shouldn&rsquo;t delve into sculpting. When I receive digital objects or assets, as sometimes happens, created by folks who mainly focused on the external aesthetics, I see a lot of wobbly tables. An awful lot. These are items that obstinately defy improvement or modification. They often won&rsquo;t even suit whatever purpose they were created for. Similar to a car built with the gas pedal nestled safely under the hood, but with an otherwise spotless interior.Game assets are deviously complex matryoshka dolls of digital information. Texture maps, normal maps, shaders, geometry, collision volumes, skin weights, skeletons, animations, local space, world space, and the reactive and interactive code that drives the whole shambling mess. Without at least a cursory understanding of each of these layers, that beautiful facade will have no place to hang. Start small, start simple, but don&rsquo;t only focus on presentation. Work from the inside out. Work on the cogs. Well built cogs can wear many faces. &#8203;\t\t"

The hardcore fighting game fan loves this stuff. Knowing how to do a launch a fireball or charge a flash kick is some sort of weird gamer secret handshake. As the years have gone on, each new game has catered to a ravenous audience that demands more secrets, more depth, greater complexity. World Heroes 2 is played with one joystick and Three buttons. Of those three buttons, you only really need to use two.This is the part where I could be expected to write about how approachable this game is. How, in a sea of complicated and intimidating fighting games, this one game is a great on ramp for someone trying to learn how to play fighting games. World Heroes 2 is not that game. It is as dense, nuanced and complex as any other fighting game, but it does all that with two buttons, and the occasional press of a third. World Heroes 2 holds its own in play style and mechanics against the Street Fighters, the Fatal Furies, the Samurai Showdowns, and the Mortal Kombats, but you only need to use two buttons. Not four, not five, not six. Two. Not only that, but World Heroes 2 introduced or refined mechanics not seen in most other fighting games. Throw reversals that predate Dead or Alive. A timed parry that came before Street Fighter 3. A deathmatch mode that has players competing in a tug of war type battle, sharing a single life bar between them. So far as I know, a feature exclusive to World Heroes 2.If World Heroes 2 is just as complicated and impenetrable as other fighting games, then what&rsquo;s the big deal about it only using two buttons? World Heroes 2 cuts straight to the heart of fighting games. Fighting games are all about timing, spacing, and finding, or forcing, openings in your opponent's guard. World Heroes 2 drops the finger gymnastics required by most fighting games, and focuses firmly on the real meat of the genre. Playing World Heroes 2 will make you better at fighting games. With the notable exception of DiveKick, I don&rsquo;t know of any fighting game that is better focused and more aware of what it is. In it&rsquo;s simplicity, hides the depth of a truly incredible game. One of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tShe had packed the box carefully. All things found their place. Some smaller bits drifted down to the bottom, while the larger, more cumbersome, items settled where they would. Nothing took any more space than required. She could have sworn that there had been no room left when she had set down the lid. Still, she felt that this box was slightly lighter than the others. Not as densely packed. It was too late in the day to gather anything else, so this would have to suffice. It was difficult to tell, anyway, without comparing directly. Maybe she only thought this box was lighter. No way to know.She shuffled toward the garage, kicking at hem of her housecoat as she crossed the mudroom doorway. That damned door sill was still loose and had a nasty habit of clawing at anything dangling within its reach. The door had come down years ago, so the sill had no partner against inclement weather anyway. She had meant to gather the hammer and tack it down. Maybe tomorrow. She slowly spun her back toward the storm door that led to the garage and gently edged it open, careful not to upset the contents of the box. It seemed to have taken most of the day to pack it. What&rsquo;s a little extra care to preserve all that work? Time well spent, she decided.There was still the last hint of pale light coming through the kitchen window, but the garage was dark, as always. Without turning, she snaked her arms back into the darkness and found a spot to fit the box into. It slid in perfectly, as it was meant to. She quickly retrieved her hands and jolted forward, letting the door swing in behind her. She felt that moment of lightheadedness, a catch in her chest, as the door creaked and clicked shut. The storm door had seemed redundant when the garage had been built, but now she was thankful for it. She smiled meekly and nodded to the storm door before relocking it and pushing closed the inside door. As dark as it was in the garage, it must be even worse between those two doors. The thought made her shiver. She double checked the inside lock.Morning. What do we do in the morning? Tea with milk. Toast. Raspberry jam. No, blueberry. Only blueberry left. Tidy up a bit. Organize the photos. Make a list.She liked to write the list longhand. She could type it. She had been exceptional on a keyboard. Certainly she retained those skills in her hands, even if she seldom applied them. Typing, and problem solving. No, not problems. Puzzles? Something with a great deal of strict thinking, but not much arithmetic. In any case, she was convinced that she could type the list, but she liked the feel of pen on paper. Those marks felt permanent.Gathering. Also there was gathering. Collecting items for the box. Most would be on the list, but sometimes other things would get in there too. She made every effort to stick to the list. Some items are just too small to keep good track of. In an instant, it was evening. The light through the kitchen window swept in grey and fading. Just a few more things to pack. She kept it all as neat as she could. Making the best use of the space in the box. Careful and organized. Nestling the contents as well she could. Sometimes jutting edges and protrusions made it difficult, but in the end, she managed it. Convinced that nothing more could be coaxed inside, she placed the lid and slid it down snug.Maybe lighter than it should be? The boxes are usually heavier. She could sense no shifting of the contents, so the box must be full, but still she wondered. Back toward the garage. The sill on that mudroom doorway still needed tamping. She looked down as she crossed it, careful not to catch any stray fibers of housecoat. What good was a sill without a door anyway. The inside door to the garage was already open. She must have done that earlier. That was helpfull. She wouldn&rsquo;t need to put down the box to open the storm door. She pressed her back up against it. A chill from the door passed ghostly through her housecoat. It made her pull her shoulders up and tremble. The door opened easily. Still very dark in the garage. Always so dark. She reached her hands around without turning her face toward the darkness. Even so, it was hard to tell if her eyes were open or closed. The box found its place, and slid in easily. One quick step forward, back into the mudroom. She felt her breath, sharper than she liked. She heard the storm door click shut behind her, and reached back to lock it without ever looking at it. Morning. What do we do in the morning? Tea. Toast. Something in it. Something on it. Some tidying, shifting items around. Look over the photos. She must have taken at least a few of them. The ones she wasn&rsquo;t in. Make a list. Write it out by hand. No other way to do it, really. Items for the box. It&rsquo;s getting dark. The box seems light and loose. It&rsquo;s filled to the top, but it feels too insubstantial. The boxes should be packed tight. She placed the lid and pressed it down. It pays to take your time, do things right. In the proper order.She passed by the doorway into the mudroom. There is a sill, but no door. Why would you have one without the other. The garage storm door is just barely open. She must have gotten it ready. Easier to carry the box that way.She pressed the storm door open with her back and thrust the box toward the darkness. It was lifted away from her hands so gently it took a moment before she knew it was gone. Back into the mudroom. Lock the door. Morning. What do we do in the morning? Tea. Toast. Make the list. The list seems short today. So few items. It may be a struggle to fill the box. She stared down at her housecoat, down at the floor below it. What would go in the box tomorrow?\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWhen I started creating this Best Games series, I really just wanted to advocate for good things. I wanted to celebrate joy and the hard work people put into creating these strange digital toys. So, with that in mind, here is another Best Game. A small break from whatever stuff you are thinking about today. Best Games - DolphinFirst the boring description.In Dolphin created by Matthew Hubbard for the Atari 2600. In case you hadn&rsquo;t guessed you play as a dolphin. The entire game is nothing more than a single, unending, chase. You swim as fast as you can to escape a giant octopus that is trying to catch you. Currents can either speed you up or slow you down. There are walls of seahorses spaced at regular intervals that extend all the way from the ocean floor to the surface of the water. Each wall will have a gap located somewhere just large enough for your dolphin to swim though. Using the tone of your sonar you can tell where that hole will be before the wall arrives on screen. When the game picks up, and your dolphin is break necking away from that octopus, you will often have to be in position to pass through that gap before you can actually see it. You can jump out of the water to catch a seagull that powers you up for some reason. A powered up dolphin can beat an octopus. Obviously. Games were pretty weird in the 80&rsquo;s.Play Dolphin, and you will notice some pretty interesting things. First off, it&rsquo;s an endless runner. This is the distant ancestor of some pretty popular mobile games, like Flappy Bird. An awful lot like Flappy Bird. Dolphin might not be the first of this type of game, but it is probably one of the first. Sure, you can change direction and head left instead of right, but you will be doing exactly the same stuff, just in the other direction. Dolphin uses a tone scale to help you decide where on the screen the gap in the wall will be. You get used to using sound cues so quickly it almost seems as though other games had just been wasting one of your senses, with their digital bloops and farts. In that way it is one of the first musical games, or at least one of the first to use sound as a game mechanic, and not just window dressing. There is a commonly known exploit in Dolphin that skilled players used to achieve very high scores. Your dolphin can jump out of the water, and if you time it right, leap completely over the wall of seahorses, ignoring the sound mechanic completely. This is also a very risky strategy, because the octopus will inevitably creep up on you, catching speedy currents, while you stay above them so you can time your jumps. If you mistime a jump you will hit the wall and get yourself knocked back toward the octopuses waiting tentacles. It&rsquo;s a tactic you can use, but eventually you will need to dive and engage with the sound mechanic again. Nailing the timing of those jumps is a precursor to rhythm games. Again, maybe not the first, but a very early example. It&rsquo;s rare that you have one game that proves out several mechanics that are still fun and relevant decades later. Tastes change, technology moves forward. Here we see at least three mechanics, new at the time, that fully hold up today. Dolphin is still one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI&rsquo;ve been very slowly working my way through this amazing book, Art of Atari put together by Tim Lapetino. Every single page reveals a new beautiful image that I have to study for a few minutes before moving on. This makes reading the actual text of the book take a lot longer than I would have expected, but I can&rsquo;t really complain. It&rsquo;s all just cover to cover gorgeous.I have read several books on the history of video games and the history of silicon valley. As you might expect, stories about the inner workings of Atari come up fairly often. Tales of the work hard, play hard lifestyle Atari had going are pretty entertaining. Since those histories tend to focus on the games, the game developers, and the fledgling business of games, a lot of this book is pretty new territory for me. As the title would suggest, the book is mainly focused on the artists and designers that created the Atari look of the late 70s and early 80s. The state of the art in actual on screen graphics at the time consisted mainly of chunky abstract blocks of color. If you were going to suspend disbelief and accept that those few yellow squares are actually a medieval warrior, bridging that gulf had to start somewhere. Playing a video game in the early 80s didn&rsquo;t start when you put the cartridge in the console. &nbsp;It started with the box art, and the pictures in the manual. It started with the brief tales of galactic adventure that accompanied them. &nbsp;the work that went into that art and design are every bit as fascinating as stories about the games they complimented. At least for me. What I was particularly taken by was how all of the art, all of the design, had to be filtered through the production technology available at the time. When I started creating commercial art, the world was well into the Photoshop era. Getting digital art out of the computer and into the physical world was still a bit janky, but creating in the computer was rapidly becoming the standard. None of these folks had that available to them. Everything had to be hand done and prepped for screen printing. Large format Inkjet printers that spray the images directly onto vinyl just didn&rsquo;t exist. The had some four colour process printers that could do the smaller stuff, like cartridge decals and product boxes, but even those lacked the fidelity of modern printers. Working to the technology available, the Atari artist and designers created some amazing things.For several years I worked designing and manufacturing signs. While most of the technology for that industry has advanced significantly since the late 70s, there are still some places where it has lagged behind print production. I have, for example, hand cut a rubylith, which is something only old timers in print and screen printing hipsters will understand. It still comes up from time to time in the sign industry though. Most of it is robots with knives issued marching orders by custom software not too dissimilar from Illustrator. Even with that experience, I have some difficulty wrapping my brain around the hurdles a designer would have to leap to get a six foot tall graphic produced and applied to an arcade cabinet. Well, I have some more amazing pictures to stare at, so I&rsquo;m going to go do that.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - One Must Fall 2097The early 90s were the era of the fighting game. Entire arcades could be filled with nothing but fighting game machines and they would still draw a crowd. It was not uncommon to see multiple versions of the same game, stood beside each other with a line queued up in front of each. Street Fighter 2 was the undisputed champion amongst fighting games, but Mortal Kombat was a strong contender. With it&rsquo;s large digitized characters and outlandish violence, Mortal Kombat was designed to catch people's attention. It was brash and blunt in a way that most games at the time just weren&rsquo;t. Most games that lean heavily on a flashy gimmick tend to have very little depth. There usually isn&rsquo;t a real game there. Mortal Kombat was a notable exception to that rule. Mortal Kombat was a solid, nuanced fighting game. Great artists steal, right?One Must Fall 2097 apes Mortal Kombat in all the ways that matter. The pace of the game. The snappy back and forth sparring paired with movement that feels deliberately languid. A less twitchy game than Street Fighter 2, Mortal Kombat could be slightly more tactical. It rewards patience and timing over aggression. One Must Fall borrows, or steals, all of these elements. It also shamelessly lifts many animations and moves from the celebrated arcade game. It does all that and replaces the gimmick of violence and digitized humans with giant cg rendered fighting robots. A solid gimmick. That could have been it. The developers of One Must Fall could have settled for making a sturdy Mortal Kombat clone, and it would have sold well. This was the early 90s after all, and fighting games on any platform would sell. One Must Fall 2097 was released on the pc in 1994, at a time when pc gaming was just starting to get exciting. Doom was installed on more computers than windows, and internet access was on the rise. One Must Fall was the right game at the right time. Popularity is great, but this is why One Must Fall gets on my best games list. They could have done a straight clone of Mortal Kombat, but they didn&rsquo;t. They built a game that plays to the strengths of the pc, rather than copying a game that was designed to digest quarters at a phenomenal rate. One Must Fall includes a deep robot customization system, and a campaign that could take hours to play, rather than the 20 or som minutes of an arcade machine. There were a surprising large roster of playable robots, and an equal array of human pilots, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. This mean that the total number of pilot / robot combinations is somewhere around 100, which is bonkers for a fighting game. Variety, play time, customization, these are the things that pc games excel at compared to their arcade counterparts. That is why One Must Fall was great. They took an established genre, with well defined boundaries and conventions, and then changed them all to best fit the pc platform. It was risky and strange and not the type of thing that an established company like Capcom or Midway would have done, at least not at that time. The game also uses a very simplified control system for a fighting game. 2 buttons, tapped rather than rolled inputs for specials. This might be thought of as a dumbing down, but One Must Fall is just as satisfying to play as its arcade cousins. Just as fast, just as tactical, just as fun.The soundtracks for Street Fighter 2 and Mortal Kombat are good, but they were made to be heard in a noisy arcade, so there are a lot of small musical stings and baselines, but that&rsquo;s the height of it. The soundtrack for One Must Fall was made to be heard in your quiet home, on your pc speakers. It rocks. Fantastic era standard techno music plays behind every metallic clang and dense thud. This isn&rsquo;t arcade sounds at home, this is sound designed for, and around the pc gaming experience. In other words, sound you can listen to for a long time without it ever becoming repetative or grating.&nbsp;It might have started as a clone, but One Must Fall 2097 rose above its origins to become one of the best games.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWell, it&rsquo;s 2017 now. I have been thinking about branching out a little on here for a while. This blog started as a development blog, because I thought that was the thing you did when you wanted to be an indie game developer. Back then I was using Microsoft XNA and just trying to learn C#. I only had the most basic grasp on a few other programming languages at the time, a few versions of basic, some rudimentary C++, a smattering of LISP and Pascal. I could make some sense of the code if I saw it, but lacked the fluency to really write much. I figured that C# was probably going to be around for a while, so I might as well focus on that. As it turned out C# has persisted, and become fairly popular, which is nice since that means there are always lots of answers available when I have questions. Now I typically use a combination of simple visual scripting with a graphical state machine system and very small C# scripts that do only one or two things, but do them well and predictably. The current tools for game development let you do a lot with small, well planned, effort. I wouldn&rsquo;t say that it is easy exactly, but it is easier than it has ever been. So that is sort of how the development part of this has gone. At some point I started writing about video games in more abstract and non specific ways. I would write about remembrances of particular games that I think are important. I would write more generally about the industry and the culture surrounding video games. Mostly I would just write. Consistently, at least once a week, I would write something. Videogames was just a topic I knew well. A resource I could mine for words on a regular schedule. Videogames were never really the point. At least not for me. Writing was the point. Writing had to become a habit. I experimented a bit, and tried to &ldquo;find my voice&rdquo;, whatever that means. I also put every post out there in public so I couldn&rsquo;t be precious with them. I rarely edit, and when I do, it is for readability and clarity, not content. I have written a few sentences that are real clunkers, and they will stay that way until this small corner of the internet is scoured from history. Here is what I think I will do going forward. Most of the time it will be the usual nonsense. A write up about an old game that only I care about. A commentary on something in the larger gaming culture that I think I might have a take on. Some of it might be personal, some of it not as much. I&rsquo;ll check in from time to time on my own work, art or development related. Once in awhile though, I will write something very different here. I might just post up a short story from my childhood, as I shakily remember it. Or I may, from time to time, post up a short bit of fiction that probably has very little to do with videogames. These I will write at times other than a few hours before I post them. I will edit them slightly more rigorously. I may even edit them and repost them with the changes. I still love videogames, and I like talking and writing about them more than I like most other things. And when I say that I mean all the things. That exist. In the world. It&rsquo;s sort of a problem. Anyway, I will continue to write and post at least one piece a week, but they might not all be about videogames. Some of them might be about bikes.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tDev Update!Believe it or not I have been doing some small amount of game development these last few months. In a sporadic fashion I reopen my project, consult my sparse documentation to see what sort of checklist items I had open, and proceed to decipher what it was I worked on last. The last time this happened, I went ahead and reworked the way my game used physics. I also looked at the next item on my list and started working on that, only to discover that my past self had already completed that particular system ( a way of dynamically creating objects from sub objects ) and had devised a simple and elegant solution to the problem. I haven&rsquo;t done nearly enough work on this game, which is too bad, because it already controls pretty well. There isn&rsquo;t nearly enough game there to be fun yet, but the connection between your fingers and the game feels nice. I&rsquo;m not going to go into any detail though. I&rsquo;m not going to write about what it took to revise the physics interactions. I&rsquo;m not going to write about the slowly, but steadily congealing game mechanics. I&rsquo;m not going to write about my concept sketches, the theme, title, influences, or game loop. The next time I write about it will be when I have something to show, and I have something for people to play and offer feedback on. Until then, I&rsquo;m just not going to talk about it.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Might and Magic Clash of HeroesDuring the reign of the nintendo DS a cavalcade of excellent games poured out of development studios and onto that small, two screened console. Many of them were overlooked, or had one or two weeks of notoriety before the next release from Level-5 or Capcom or Nintendo themselves launched, completely eclipsing any smaller releases. Might and Magic is a name that can catch the attention of long time PC gamers, but outside of that small audience, the name really doesn&rsquo;t count for much. Add to that, the fact that Clash of Heroes is only very tangentially related to the rest of the Might and Magic series. This game was doomed to obscurity from the jump. That&rsquo;s an incredible shame, because Clash of Heroes might be one of the finest strategy games made in the last several years.The meat of Clash of Heroes is matching three, or more, like items to create some effect. This lead a lot of review outlets to classify it as a puzzle game. This assessment could not be more wrong. There is nothing puzzle game about it. In Clash of Heroes you will match 3, but the game is not a match 3 game. That is just the mechanism by which you mete out your moves.Three in a row vertically is an attack move and three in a row horizontally builds a defensive wall. Defence enacts as soon as you play it, but attack will take a different amount of turns to charge up depending on the type of attack and units involved. The real game is looking for holes in your opponent's defence while shoring up your own, using very limited resources. When you find yourself looking to set up attacks and counters 2 or 3 turns from now, anticipating moves your opponent will make, you notice how deviously clever and simple a strategy game Clash of Heroes really is. It has more in common with othello than bejewelled. There is one mechanic that completely cements Clash of Heroes as a strategy game. Rather than being completely formulaic like chess, Clash of Heroes contains one random element. The placement of pieces on the board is completely unknown when you start the game. After pieces are removed from the board you are able to replenish them by hitting the reinforce button. The new pieces slide in behind your existing ranks only semi-randomly. The game will never create a match three on it&rsquo;s own. Only the player can do that, either by moving or removing a piece. When the new reinforcements enter the board, you can be absolutely sure of the places they won&rsquo;t be. Depending on the way the board is already set up, a lot of the time that also means that you will know where they will end up too. This lets you start planning new moves. If you added elements of a deck building card game to chess, Clash of Heroes would be the result.When you pile on the variety of unique units, the cutesy but solid art, and the serviceable and sometimes grin inducing story, you end up with a game that didn&rsquo;t receive the attention it deserved. It is currently available on every platform you can touch or plug a controller into, so maybe someday it will be recognized as the true classic it is. Might and Magic Clash of Heroes is one of the best games.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\t  I&rsquo;ve been tracing. Sometime late in high school I decided not to copy other artist's work. It wasn&rsquo;t any sort of moral stance. I didn&rsquo;t feel like I owed Erik Larsen an apology for redrawing one of his spiderman panels. I wasn&rsquo;t selling them, or claiming that I came up with the drawing. I certainly didn&rsquo;t come up with the character. Like a lot of kids, I was reproducing other people's work as a way to understand it. I thought that if I could decode how Ron Lim put together a splash page of silver surfer fighting Mephisto, I could someday learn to draw like him. Then I stopped doing that. I drew from life, things I could see. I drew bowls of fruit, both nude and clothed human models, and a few animals. I would use photo reference, but only as a piece of a different composition. I completely stopped recreating other artwork, and I never ever traced something.I don&rsquo;t know who told me that tracing was cheating. I can&rsquo;t remember if anyone even did. In any case I never traced, even when it would have been sensible. Drawing a brand new pose for a character just to try out different costumes is really not sensible.I did some tracing recently, and realized I have been very stupid. Of course now I know that artists have been tracing for as long as it has been possible. Vermeer, tracer. Norman Rockwell, tracer. Neal Adams, proud tracer. So much landscape, still life, and portrait art was traced from a camera obscura projection, it would be difficult to tally it up. For whatever reason I considered it cheating, probably because so much of the rest of the world considers it cheating. Here is an image I am currently working on.         And here are the steps I took to make it.&nbsp;Like a most drawings, this one comes from an idea. I&rsquo;m trying to represent the attitude of a whole group of characters as they are described in text. So the first thing I do is draw a page of quick dirty sketches.         I&rsquo;m really just trying to imagine what the character is thinking, so I&rsquo;m drawing poses and postures. Most of this probably doesn&rsquo;t look like much, but I also usually don&rsquo;t save this step. I just draw and delete a bunch of stuff until I have a bead on the character. This sketching part is probably the same no matter if you are going to trace or not.Next I may or may not do some image searches on google to see clothes, postures, and interesting faces. In this case, I didn&rsquo;t.&#8203;Next comes the interesting part. There is an addon for Blender called&nbsp;ManuelbastioniLABhttp://www.manuelbastioni.com/&nbsp;an open source, blender specific, offshoot of MakeHuman. Both&nbsp;ManuelbastioniLAB and MakeHuman are collections of nice clean 3d models of humans with all sorts of adjustment sliders to make all sorts of different &ldquo;humans&rdquo;. I use ManuelbastioniLAB to create a pretty generic looking person inside Blender. I use all the sliders and tools to make a person sort of close to what I am looking for. Then I use the included skeleton to pose the character, and I adjust the camera and lights to approximate what I will be going for in the final image. Then I render out a quick version, which usually consists of just taking a screenshot.         My original intent was to take a screenshot and then use that as reference the same way I would use a photo. I would look at it and redraw the relevant bits just beside on my screen. For whatever reason, the act of moving the image from one place to another by looking here and drawing over there is not really considered cheating.Instead, I thought, well the picture is right here on my screen, on another layer of the same file in fact. Why don&rsquo;t I just draw over it? So I did. I felt like I was cheating, but I got the landmarks and fiddly bits out of the way incredibly quickly, if you don't count all that time setting up and posing the model. It let me work more on getting the right attitude and dealing with costuming and making all the little changes that just didn&rsquo;t work in the initial pose. The position of the eyes, the tightness of the lips, size of the chin, Subtly repositioning the shoulders and fingers until this single captured moment says what I want it to say.&nbsp;&#8203;         Now I don&rsquo;t know if this technique will work for everyone. Maybe you have to do it the hard way for a while before tracing becomes a tool you can use without being slavish to the source material. I honestly can&rsquo;t say. I do know that I was a bit rusty in the drawing department, having spent years sculpting and 3D modelling, but tracing helped me out a lot. I did a few freehand sketches on paper just yesterday, and found that laying down poses and rough camera angles felt much easier. Maybe I just needed to trace for a while.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games &ndash; Oddworld: Stranger's WrathGames that try to do too many things are usually failures. It's the kitchen sink approach. The developers try to put a little of everything into the game and the whole thing collapses under the weight. Of course, there are times when that approach succeeds spectacularly.Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath is a third person action platformer, a first person shooter, a stealth action game, and a character adventure game. That is a list of way too many things. There is no way this game should work. Each of those elements are handled well, but not polished to the level of a game dedicated to any single one of those genres. If you put that list before a room of game designers, they would unconsciously start crossing off items before they realized what their hands were doing. Putting all of those requirements together in one place is a terrible idea. Still, Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath is on my list as one of the best games.Imagine that there was a much loved animated series from your childhood. It combined a western backdrop with a Jim Henson-esque attitude to weirdness and subtle humour. Some years later, a game studio got hold of that license, and set out to make an homage to all the things you loved about that old series. All the characters, all the locations, all the inside jokes. Not only did they make that game, they did right by the material, and they did right by your nostalgia. Nothing less than a kitchen sink approach to game design would have worked. There was just too much material to cover.Of course that show never existed. The stranger isn't an old beloved character. He exists only in the context of this one game, but he, and the world he occupies, feels like it springs straight from your fond memories.There were other Oddworld games before Stranger's Wrath, and while they are all beautifully designed, and equally eccentric, they don't share they same sense of being part of a much larger world. Stranger's Wrath feels like a story started and finished during the second act of a much longer series.Stranger's Wrath was first released on the original XBOX. Some of the textures and models are showing signs of age. I would say, that in terms of design, it still ranks up there as one of the more visually amazing games to ever be released. There isn't a density of detail on display, in fact some areas are so desolate and barren, that the feeling of loneliness is suffocating. As you play through the game, you realize that the loneliness is intentional. It is as much a choice as the lush and vibrant setting you eventually pass through.The environment is an equal participant in this story. Just like it was in the source material. You remember that old show. You know, from when you were growing up. Yeah that one, with the magical creatures, and the old west, and the dark undertones. The one that is an allegory for growing up and the search for personal identity, while still being a solid adventure story full of silly humour and asides to the audience. Yeah, that one.Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath, one of the best games. &nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThis past Thursday I put together a presentation for the local game developers group. I said a couple months ago that I would do something based around animation. I had done a simple rundown of 3D graphics terms about two years ago and it seemed like it was high time that I did another one, but this time focused around animation. My goal with these is always to demystify 3D graphics. I am always amazed at how incredibly simple most 3D programs are to use. The only problem for most people is getting over the very daunting introduction. I have Blender open right now, and there are no fewer than 50 input boxes that can receive numbers, letters, special characters, or some combination of all three. I won&rsquo;t even try to count the buttons, sliders, and other UI elements. There are a bunch of those that can be toggled and fiddled with. I also need to use at least three fingers on both hands just to navigate the interface, something that is unconscious muscle memory to me now, but requires a learned dexterity not unlike playing a musical instrument.I&rsquo;ll revise that first bit. I said that 3D programs are simple. I still think that they are, but simple in the way a harmonica is simple. Anyone can blow into a harmonica and create a pleasing sound, but it takes hours of practice to do anything more than that. I take that time for granted, and I think a lot of the tutorials you see out there do as well. Sometimes, what people really need to know is, will what I&rsquo;m doing break something. Is this tool that I am being told to use some magical thing that only works one way, or is it part of a system that I can pull apart to be used in different ways. Once you remove the mystery of how it works, maybe someone who could be an excellent animator will spend that time. They can get truly good at it.I think the talk went okay. I could detect some boredom in the crowd, but it was tough to tell if it was because I was talking too high level, too low level, or just too rambly and all over the place. Animation is not really a topic that you can sum up in 20 minutes, especially if you are trying to explain any of the technical aspects of 3D animation. I decided to only cover a couple of topics. So maybe a bit dull and simplistic for the technical level of the room (which is quite high), but overall not a complete bomb. On the upside, the nuts and bolts of the presentation worked perfectly. Just having the computer connect to the projector, and having a microphone stand positioned properly while using a program that requires both hands. In fact, it worked so well that I was wishing a few minutes in that I had brought more examples and talking points. I have attached the link to all the files I used for the demonstration here, so you too can install Blender and mess around with a very basic skinned character.    \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI want to talk about fear. None of us is fearless. Fear is a great driver of human nature. Fear caused us to congregate in groups and tribes to ward off large predators. Fear moved us to harness fire, and to invent weapons and tools. It can cripple or it can motivate. Even when we lack a direct threat, we have evolved minds that can conjure new fears to propel us. We all feel it and we all use it. It seems fair to say, in that way, all people are equal. In fear, we are all the same.Let me tell you about my fears. They are probably similar to a lot of other people's fears. My fears are what ifs and could be&rsquo;s. I wrestle with potential future events and tragic outcomes. I worry about impending disasters that I can address or allay with careful planning. I fear for my children. I fear damage to my home. I have fears about running out of food, or water, or air. I fear disease and failing health. I fear the loss of the good things in my life.Most of my fears have no teeth. Things are going along pretty well, and will likely continue along that trajectory. Nothing of any substance has happened to me to make me think otherwise.I know that I am statistically very lucky. I had the good fortune of being born in one of the safer, and more stable countries in the world. By nearly all metrics there are not many better places I could live. I was fortunate to come into a loving family that supported and sheltered me. I also had the good fortune to be born male. That matters less here than in some other places, but it still counts as an advantage. Here is where I will lose a lot of people who read this. You might be one of them. You will read that line above, the one about having been born male being an advantage and you will check out. You are a rational, thoughtful person, and you know that in this modern western society, the opportunities afforded women, given similar education and experience, are equal. You are a rational and thoughtful person, and you don&rsquo;t harbour backward notions of sexism. Besides, you never thought of oppressing anyone. I&rsquo;ll grant you that. You probably believe in a meritocracy. An equal and fair society where no one is held back, but no one is offered preferential treatment either. Not for race, gender, or orientation. Not for cultural background or personal beliefs. You believe in equality. You think that way because you are a rational and thoughtful person. You don&rsquo;t let your fears control you.Let me tell you a few others things I know about me. I'm white. Heterosexual. Tallish. Nothing about me draws particular attention. No unique marks or physical conditions. I wouldn't stand out in a crowd, at least not where I live. I am unlikely to be singled out, pointed at or talked about. All of this has had the cumulative effect of me never really being scared. I have been afforded that. I have been gifted that. Of course I feel fear like any other human, but all the circumstances of location and genetics that make me who I am have also moderated my fear. My fears are hypothetical. I have to construct them myself, a stitch at a time, creating draperies of anxieties that I can use to ward off possible unsavory futures. I have made it very easy for myself to believe that we are all equal in our fear, and that fear is something to be controlled and surmounted.All people feel fear. In that, we are all the same. Our fears are equivalent. No one person's fears should be placed above any others. That wouldn&rsquo;t be fair. right?There are a lot of people who aren&rsquo;t like me. There are people who, due to random throws of chance feel conspicuous. That fear is not the same as mine. It is not hypothetical. It is the very real and immediate fear of other people looking directly at them. It is a chronic fear. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter that I, or you, have no intention of oppressing them. That isn&rsquo;t how people feel fear. That isn&rsquo;t how fear works. It is a level of fear that I can&rsquo;t really imagine. I am able to abstract my fear and examine it. I can safely put it aside as something to plan for and deal with another day. I will not be accosted in the street today. I will not have someone take notice of me and stare at a train stop today. I will not have someone make a hurtful remark in my direction when I go to get coffee today. I will not feel conspicuous. I will not have that fear burn away inside me, making me look for a safe place to simply be a person. Some people are not afforded that luxury. They feel fear built from experiences, not intangibles. Many small jabs, some unintended, but pervasive. Continuous. Regular. Normal. Their fear is, that the same injuries and terrors that happened today will happen tomorrow, and the next day, and the next. It is the sort of fear that I have no experience with, and never will. I can only empathize. I can&rsquo;t stop someone from feeling afraid. I can&rsquo;t tell them that it will be okay, and have that be enough. I also don&rsquo;t have to, in the name of fairness, contribute to it. I don&rsquo;t have to be party to hurtful words or actions, and I don&rsquo;t have to ignore them when they are casually uttered. I can be thoughtful, and rational, and logical, and maybe even try to be objective, but I can&rsquo;t tell someone that the fear they are feeling is wrong. I can&rsquo;t debate away their fear. I can&rsquo;t pretend that we are all equal. In fear, we are not.I damn well don&rsquo;t have to be what they are afraid of, and you don&rsquo;t have to be either.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tGames used to be different.I tend to dislike &ldquo;used to be&rdquo; stories. You know the ones. The world used to be like this, or people used to act like that. Even when they are partially factual, they fall to close to &ldquo;back in my day&rdquo; stories. They reference a time that probably didn&rsquo;t exist and tend to gloss over all sorts of terrible stuff in favour of some half remembered reverie. &nbsp;Okay. Wait. I&rsquo;m getting really close to talking about history, and that will lead to talking about politics. Let&rsquo;s get this back on track.So video games used to be different. Video games have always been as much of a commercial endeavor as they are an artistic one. You can write a song with a cigar box guitar, but you can&rsquo;t make a video game without a bunch of expensive computer hardware and technical know how. In that way, making video games as an artistic pursuit is a lot like building hot rods. Sure you can make an artistic statement, but you are going to have to pay for all of those tools and time somehow. The obvious answer is that you sell the hot rods, or games, as the case may be.Okay. Nope. Absolutely heading in the direction of talking about economics, or class privilege of certain hobbies. I should probably reset.Video games in the arcade used to be different. The need to turn a profit on these games meant that high difficulty, heavy emphasis on action, and quick player turnover was a design requirement. Wait. That statement was just blatantly about economics. I was going to write something about the way games have evolved from an action to an experience based artform, but I was never really going to take a side as to whether that was a good or bad thing. It was going to be completely apolitical. I am having trouble thinking of anything to write about this stupid, escapist hobby that couldn&rsquo;t have a political bent to it. It&rsquo;s almost as if all the video games are made by messy humans for other messy humans and we view and enjoy them through our messy individual experiences. If I start heading down any of these lines of examination, I&rsquo;m going to encounter sexism, racism, classism, economics, factions, negotiation and compromises, regionalism, marketing and propaganda, and the neverending onslaught of history. This is what I think when people put out the call to remove politics from video games. The very notion that politics could be removed from any human communication, including this shared entertainment medium, is beyond bizarre. Objectively reacting to art is not possible, taking politics out of your enjoyment is not possible. Politics exist because humans exist. If you think that someone with a different point of view than yours is &ldquo;ruining video games&rdquo;. I think that studying some history, even if it&rsquo;s only the history of games, might be helpful not only to you, but everyone else. I have a fair bit more rant left in me, but I try to keep this blog to video games, and I try to keep it mostly positive. So I&rsquo;ll stop there. Maybe next time&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll write why E.T. isn&rsquo;t that bad a game, and see how that goes. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the GalaxyThere was never any chance that text adventures would last. Not in any real way. There are a lot of people who still dabble in the genre, and a few techno hipsters that would swear up and down that text based games are more pure than games with graphics, or some such nonsense.Text adventures were a stopgap of course. They were the best that developers could do with the resources that they had. If they could have made an interactive story with graphics and sound there is no way that they would ever have stuck with text. In a lot of ways, games like the Elder Scrolls or Mass Effect series are direct descendants of text adventures. Had it been possible to have your character walk through lavish locations rather than describing them in text, that&rsquo;s what would have happened. It&rsquo;s tough to get the same level of detail in 200 pixels with a pallet of 4 colors than you can in one well worded paragraph. Text adventures were always destined to be overtaken. All of the great games from the text adventure era could be realized better today with a modern audio visual experience. All of them except one. Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy banks entirely on the writing. Not writing in the sense of vibrant descriptions of locations, or interesting nuanced characters. The literal, one word following another to create a clever joke type of writing. &nbsp;The precise placement of words magic trick comedians tend to use to such great effect. The writing in Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy is all setup and punchline. Even the puzzles. Especially the puzzles. There are several occasions where the game plays with the text you type in to create either a setup or a punchline, as if the writers could predict your behaviour well enough to invite you to participate in the joke. The game itself is damn near impossible to beat without repeated playthroughs. It might even be unfair from time to time, dangling an easy puzzle solution in front of you just to yank it away and then joke about it. I certainly never completed it, back when I was much younger, and slower at typing. I did keep playing it though, for the near endless supply of funny phrases, situations, and asides that could be unearthed from every command you punched into the text parser. I pull it up on one of the many places it can be played on the web, probably once a year at least. I play through until just after I get the babel fish and then usual mess up and have the game murder me in some hilarious fashion. Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy is one of the few games that was such a perfect blending of time, execution, and technology that I don&rsquo;t think there is any way to meaningfully improve on it with new tools. Graphics wouldn&rsquo;t improve it, and the only sound that could be added might be a skilled narrator. Specifically a skilled, british, narrator. You would probably do just as well to imagine John Cleese reading all the lines. The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy is still on the of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWhat you are really designing against is boredom. Somewhere along the path to writing that book or composing that song or staging that production, they have all had that thought. It might have been a twinging type of thought, ephemeral, just barely there and then gone. A thought not fully considered. Never rolled around the mind and tasted like rich liquor. The foremost design challenge is boredom. This song has 4 verses rather than 5. The chorus repeats 6 times.This play runs 1.5 hours not 2.This movie is 128 minutes long instead of 115 or 132.This chapter reads around 17 minutes long. This one 45. It includes the word &ldquo;Floppily&rdquo;All tightly constructed, all timed and tuned and set to a metronome. Usually this tuning is done intuitively, often attributed to the influence of muses and artistic sprites. Make no mistake, designing against boredom is precise as surgery. Maybe it is the infancy of the medium that is to blame, or the influence of large teams all pulling and stretching the design till it barely holds. Games have a boredom problem. Arguably the most exciting, engaging, visceral artform created by humans, and yet, most are deeply boring for long intervals. It&rsquo;s the interactivity. It is very difficult to time and tune an experience when the jackass experiencing it is in control of the pacing. You can design the game, but you can&rsquo;t design the player. If the player thinks that they need to walk everywhere in the world you have created, and they think that walking everywhere is boring, you won&rsquo;t be in their home to point out that they are standing next to a horse. It won&rsquo;t matter. They will be bored and quit your game, and maybe leave a bad Steam review. So instead, say that you attach a giant neon sign to the horse reading &ldquo;Press x to ride horse&rdquo;. If they player is somehow able to miss this sign horse combo, you have the horse make a lazy pass through the players field of view every minute or so. Some players, occasionally even the ones that would have missed the horse outright, will feel patronized and offended that the sign is there, leading rapidly to boredom and the same poor Steam review. How then, to ensure that players don&rsquo;t become bored while playing, or become bored while you try to explain to them how to not be bored while playing. I honestly wish I knew. I have narrowed the problem space down for you considerably though. Any design task, any edit, any refinement, should only ever have to answer the question, is this boring. More to the point, would someone else find this boring.BOO! (you know, to combat the boredom)&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI think pro wrestling is awesome. I try to stay current with the personalities and performers. I have read no fewer than four books by wrestlers about wrestling. At least the book jackets said that they were written by those wrestlers. I actively seek out news about the current state of wrestling every few months. I find the whole business fascinating. Now I haven&rsquo;t actually watched a whole pro wrestling show in at least a decade. I have watched a few isolated matches, some great japanese and mexican stuff, a couple of smaller american promotions. I started out this paragraph by stating that I think pro wrestling is awesome. As a concept, I do, but I also think that, as presented, it is pretty terrible most of the time. I like the absurdity. Giant muscley men, and increasingly women, yelling about how badly they are going to injure one another. They then engage in precision acrobatics and careful, practiced, stunt work in an effort to ensure that none of them are ever actually injured. Occasionally one of the characters will be particularly odd, or the audience will be informed that a wrestler has some sort of super power or magical ability. The more absurd it is, the more I enjoy it. If a well performed wrestling show was put together where every single character was a bizarre superhuman or wizard or alien or something, I would be all over that. Any time a wrestling show attempts to dip into some sort of realism, or plays off relationship problems, or interpersonal squabbles, I rapidly lose interest. None of those storylines jibe with the rest of the proceedings. The more ridiculous the move, the more preposterous the spot, the more pro wrestling works. Saddling that with a narrative about one of the performer's personal lives is kind of gross. The story and the action are at odd with each other.I have talked a bit about how games like Uncharted fall into this same trap. The attempt to humanize the player character during the story beats falls flat when he or she is essentially a walking tank through the gameplay sections. The only way to balance this dichotomy is to either let the story blaze off into the realm of the fantastical, or reduce the action to something believable. Through the century or so of pro wrestling history, the issue of story being at odds with presentation has seemingly not been solved. Comics, specifically superhero comics, tend to skirt the issue of story and action subverting one another by making sure that all proceedings live fully in the realm of the absurd. Super powered humans clad in flashy primary colors defending the city, the planet, the universe, from equally bizarre villains. This is where myths live. This is the territory of gods and monsters, titans and demons. When anything is possible, nothing seems corny or trite. Something very interesting happens when your characters and narrative occupy this heightened state of fantasy. A small, quiet, personal moment from the likes of a Batman or Superman can land with all of the emotional intensity of the finest drama. Spider-Man can make you cry, Daredevil can test the boundaries of your empathy, and Galactus can make you consider your small and profound place in the universe. Absurd is never the tagline. Absurd is not the word that hollywood and literary luminaries use to pitch projects. The words gritty or grounded or realistic get tossed around. We&rsquo;ve been there. Pro wrestling attempts gritty or grounded week in and week out, with almost universally awful results. Absurd, works. Absurd opens the door for affecting metaphor, for illuminating the personal and small by contrast with the inconceivably large. Let absurd be your watchword. &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI have been doing a lot of 3D modelling lately. The tools I have to work with now are so much better, so much richer, more stable, and capable than anything I ever used in the past. This isn&rsquo;t because, Blender, the suite of tools I am using is any better than the others available. In fact, strong arguments could be made to the contrary. Maya, Houdini, ZBrush, and 3D Studio Max, are all probably better in some ways than Blender. Still, through the march of time, all of the tools currently in use are quite simply the best they have ever been. Almost none of this clever software design makes it easier to make a model.You might think that new tools would simplify the process. What took artists ages to create for Jurassic Park would now be somehow boiled down to a &ldquo;Make Dinosaur&rdquo; button. The tools are a bit more glossy, and profoundly faster and more stable than they used to be, but the process of &nbsp;creating a model or animating a character hasn&rsquo;t really changed much since I started working with 3D programs in the late 90s. Some of that might seem obvious. Pencils haven&rsquo;t changed much since people found you can scrape a burnt stick across a rock. The fundamentals of animation, putting one picture after another and playing them back as a continuous stream hasn&rsquo;t changed for a century. But 3D modelling and animation is high tech stuff, and high tech stuff is supposed to grow and evolve in great revolutionary waves. Most of what I do still consists of shifting vertices around a 3 dimensional grid and managing layers of interrelated data. Everything is still built of triangles.A few times, just this week, I have been reminded that what I do is more about very basic geometry than any particular new tool. It&rsquo;s more about cascading inheritance of data down a long chain of subtle operations than the whizz-bang of a new digital sculpting tool. There is a reason why every athlete with media training has the line &ldquo;we just have to work on the fundamentals&rdquo; tucked in their back pocket. Fundamentals is all there really is. Once you grasp the fundamentals, anything else, any other advanced feature or time saving technique, is just a choice. You can take it or leave it. If you want to learn 3D modelling or animation, learn about geometry, learn about organizing data. Everything else, every other tool, every other technique, is a preference. Do what makes you happy.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Smash TVDid you know that The Godfather wasn&rsquo;t the first gangster movie? There were a lot of them. Like really, a lot. All sorts. Funny ones, scary ones, true ones, boring ones. All the types of gangster movie. The Godfather is still one of the best. &ldquo;How can that be?&rdquo; you might ask. How could there be so many of the same type of movie, and one of them is somehow better than almost all of the others. Except Goodfellas. Goodfellas is better. The Godfather and Goodfellas were built on a legacy of similar films and stories. They used all of the same ingredients, but those movies mixed them in a more successful way. It&rsquo;s success through iteration. Movies aren&rsquo;t usually very good at that. Games though, games are rooted in iteration. The only way to make a game is to iterate, and the only way to make a better game is to iterate more. Movie sequels and remakes tend to be worse than the originals, but games follow the opposite trend. Every subsequent version and revision tends to be better than the last. Every sequel improves. Even games that aren&rsquo;t direct follow ups to previous works can benefit from past innovations and build on them.Smash TV is spawned from Robotron 2084, Berserk, and Space Dungeon. All decent games in their own right, but Smash TV combines all of those same ingredients into something outstanding. Borrowing not only from other games, but also prominent action satire movies of the same era like Robocop and The Running Man makes Smash TV a surreal and nightmarish affair. With no real story, except what is delivered through the environment and set dressing, the player is left wondering what awful events could possibly have transpired to result in this game. Two shirtless men gleefully enter televised arenas and battle hordes of bald clones armed with 2x4s, laser firing robots, snake people, and enormous armoured mutants, for VCRs, luggage, and meat. None of that really matters, since the gameplay is so sharp, difficult, and relentless, that most players won&rsquo;t notice a lot of the nonsense around the periphery. Actually beating Smash TV in an arcade must have cost a small fortune in quarters. Some of the stages nuzzle right up to the border of impossible.I won&rsquo;t stand here and say that Smash TV is a perfect game. Some of the subject matter alone might put some people off. Even back in the dark ages of 1990, I think that presenting women as prizes was considered pretty skeezy. It&rsquo;s sometimes hard to tell how much of that stuff is deliberate satire, or just the result of a game developed by a room full of&nbsp;dudes, who may have actually thought it was cool. If the point was to be unsettling, Smash TV probably does a better job of it than the movies it&rsquo;s emulating. Smash TV iterates on the precise, demanding play of previous games, it iterates on the nasty, sarcastic subtext of late 80s action movies, and it even manages to make fun of itself. Smash TV is one of the best games.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThe first game that I ever played networked multiplayer, was Doom. That isn&rsquo;t true. I wish that it were true, but it&rsquo;s not. Getting Doom to connect was an arduous task and we didn&rsquo;t get it right the first, third, or 15th times. The first game that I ever played in networked multiplayer was Wing Commander Armada. A friend and I connected our computers across a ping pong table using a null modem RS-232 cable. I don&rsquo;t know why we knew that it would work, but apparently the ancient nerd knowledge had been delivered unto us and it was our responsibility to carry it forward. With some work we were able to set up a multiplayer game of Wing Commander Armada, but the experience was pretty lackluster. We were both huge Wing Commander fans, having played the first and second games in the series several times. This game was different. It was a combat focused game with no real story to speak of, where you flew against wave after wave of enemy ships, or in this case, against other players. When the game finally registered the connection and both of us were able to choose ships, it was pretty amazing. We got into a dogfight or 12, and while it was fun, watching a speeding dot whizz across your screen once in awhile didn&rsquo;t really feel like competitive multiplayer gaming. After an hour or two, we decided to give Doom another try. We had learned a few things setting up Wing Commander Armada, so we tore back into the arcane workings of Doom network connections. Eventually, after reading and rereading console commands off what amounted to the internet of 1994, a handwritten note on lined paper, we got it. Moments later we were connected and standing face to face in a Doom level. I mean, I could literally see my friend on the other side of the ping pong table, but something about being able to also see the flat stanley Doom Guy guided by his finger movements was pure magic. We were sharing another space composed of circuits and code, our screens acting like windows to a simulated, but newly real place. Real because there was now another person there. Past multiplayer games, where both players shared the same screen and moving characters around was much like moving pieces on a board, or magnets on a fridge, couldn&rsquo;t compare. I saw our shared world from my view, and he saw it from his. If he were to walk around a corner, out of my sight, neither of us stopped existing. We now lived as much in that Doom level as we did in his basement. A frenetic shooting gallery had instantly become a real place, a tangible world, not because of the visual fidelity or complex interaction, but because it was shared with another person.I have played a lot of networked multiplayer games since then, and that magic hasn&rsquo;t faded. I occasionally jump into a game of Minecraft or Terraria with my kids, and it is still thrilling when I see their game character jump up and down. We point to some far off monument in that shared world and strike out for whatever adventures we can find. I still play a lot of games. I know the map of Dark Souls&rsquo; Lordran or the Mass Effect&rsquo;s Citadel as well as a lot of places in the real world, but no game world has ever felt real until I shared it with someone else.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI went to school for computer animation in 1998. You can go and look up the first release of the juggernaut graphics package Maya. When I started school Maya hadn&rsquo;t been released. We learned for the first few months, the ins and outs of Power Animator. Before the School year was over, we had transitioned from Power Animator to Maya on Irix Silicon Graphics O2 computers.While finishing up my final class reel I was running pirated copies of Maya on a pentium 2 machine at home running windows NT and carrying the files back and forth to school on zip disks. Everything was moving so fast it was hard to keep up. Adobe also had their main video compositing program move from Mac only to both Mac and Windows I concluded that year creating animation and assembling video with tools that didn&rsquo;t even exist when I started. It seemed that if you blinked, the industry would pass right by you. Many times through the years I have thought that I had gotten too far behind, I had lost touch with the current software trends. I had missed the only chance I had to learn about dynamic tessellation or creating a perfect walk cycle. Everyone else had kept up the pace and I had not. As one popular computer language fell out of favour to be succeeded by the new hotness, I would never have the chance to board that train. It was gone.I have used no fewer than five different 3D programs at actual jobs, and lord knows how many I have messed with on my own time. I have used nearly as many video editors, image editors, sound editors, and IDEs. Every single one of them had their own quirks and workflows. Every single one of them required a training period. I would flail hopelessly at the keys and menus attempting to produce a result until something approaching acceptable fired out the other end. I continue to do that. Every time I open up LightWorks (my current favorite video editor) I have to relearn some part of it. Every single time. I have never, and will never master it, but every time I create something in LightWorks, I get just a tiny bit better at editing video. Every time I adjust some vertices in Blender or Silo or Unity or whatever it is I&rsquo;m working with that day, I get just a little better at 3D modelling. When you are grinding for levels, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter what monsters you fight. XP is XP.The tools still change at an incredible rate. There are always new ways of solving problems or accomplishing tasks. It can be tough to keep up with every iteration. Entire generations of tools can whiz right past you before you find yourself picking them up again. I don&rsquo;t worry about losing touch anymore. I don&rsquo;t worry that I will be left behind. It turns out that while the tools get better, the results, creating interesting art and solving problems are the same as they ever were. If learning the new tools is incorporated as a part of the process of creating you can never really get left behind. Fearing that flailing period while you learn can slow you down, but building it into your process gives you license to try anything. So flail. Flail at everything. Flail at art, flail at process, flail at technique, flail at creating. You can really only get better. &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI just spent the last few minutes searching the web for the origin of a particularly striking image. It ended up coming from Hong Kong based artist Alex FaiChan (http://alexfaichan.wix.com/de-saturation). The picture was only one of many excellent illustrations in his portfolio. If his career is anything like most of the working artists that I know, the stuff he can actually share on his portfolio is just a sliver of the work he has done over the years. The overwhelming majority of it is probably owned by some other company and doesn&rsquo;t legally belong to him. This was an image created by a commercial artist. It is unlikely that he spent days, or even hours, on that picture. That is just not the way we (I&rsquo;ll include myself here too) are wired. He probably creates a lot more than anyone will ever see. I might not be working at the pace that I tended to when under deadline, but I still generate a lot more stuff than I ever present to the world. I have deleted more 3D models in early to mid stages than I will ever complete. Sometimes I need to explore a lot of dead ends before I arrive at a useable model, or a competent image. All of that work isn&rsquo;t wasted. It is important and foundational. It is likely the sort of work that as a younger artist, I would have cherished as my very best stuff. The finest I had created up till that point. Now I discard it, because I would rather it didn&rsquo;t clutter up my hard drive. More importantly, I don&rsquo;t really feel like I have &ldquo;best stuff&rdquo; anymore. There are pieces I have sculpted, drawn, animated, or programmed that I think are nice to look at or do their job well, but I don&rsquo;t really see any of it as great. Okay, this isn&rsquo;t some emo artsy nonsense. I don&rsquo;t flagellate myself in darkness awaiting the muses. I just don&rsquo;t really have strong feelings about any one creation or work. I think this is probably the default setting for working artists, if they consider creating their job. I doubt that accountants covet a particularly well filled in ledger. It is just one of many tasks they will accomplish in a day. Feeling satisfied with work well done is far better than seeking to create a masterpiece. I don&rsquo;t know Alex FaiChan, but I looked at his work. The image that led me to his portfolio is only one of many. A task well done, a standard met. Not a masterpiece. Not of particular importance. At least not to the artist that created it. How can I infer this from his work? He didn&rsquo;t stop. He hasn&rsquo;t quit. He still makes new images and none are in any place of prominence on his site. At least outwardly, he doesn&rsquo;t seem to care more about one piece of art over the others. It is the collection of work that matters. This is the mindset of a working artist. Thumb up to the working artist. They people that design logos and pinstriping on busses. The people that create illustrations for cereal boxes. The artists that create scores of icons, text treatments, page layouts, and storyboards. The design of your calendar, the lines and curves or your coffee pot. None of them care about creating a masterpiece. These works are not intended for museum walls or historical reverence. They are created to make our world just a little more pleasant to look at. &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tFour months, 112 hours (47 hours and 65 hours on two different characters), and 257 deaths later, I have finished Dark Souls. Or maybe it&rsquo;s more accurate to say I am finished with Dark Souls. There are a few side things that I didn&rsquo;t completely wrap up, a few monsters left unchallenged. I took a quick look at some of the dlc, but I have done nothing of note in Oolacile. All in all, I think I&rsquo;m satisfied. I have drunk my fill of Dark Souls, and I don&rsquo;t really feel like heading back for more any time soon. Maybe I&rsquo;ll feel differently the next time the Steam sale rolls around.If you don&rsquo;t know anything about Dark Souls, it is a game where you ferry a clumsy warrior made of jerky through Lordran, a lavishly set designed, but sparsely populated medieval heavy metal fantasy theme park. It&rsquo;s all of the Barad-dur parts of Lord of the Rings and none of the Shire bits. I&rsquo;m not tearing it down, I played the thing for 112 hours after all, but if that description doesn&rsquo;t appeal to you, there may be other games for you. There are a spare few games that I have ever put that sort of time into. The last would probably be Mass Effect, but that was 3 games spread over a few years. Dark Souls does feature a Wolf the size of a semi truck swinging an equally enormous sword held sideways in its mouth, but viking metal attitude and ridiculous epic visuals can&rsquo;t be the only reason I stuck around that long. I felt that the game was probably too long by a third, and some areas (looking at you Lost Izalith) existed only to pad out the length. Like poor B-sides to an otherwise solid album. Match that with the way that I play games these days, half and hour here, hour there, two hours at a stretch is a rare luxury, and Dark Souls seemed to roll on for ages. During the late days of the Playstation 2 a game that had a total play time less than 16 hours was considered a waste of money. There wasn&rsquo;t really a venue for a game that could express its complete experience in under 8 hours, let alone the three or four hour range that a lot of celebrated indie games currently occupy. Often a game would have only a few hours of real content, but that content would be repeated to the point of tedium to satisfy the notion that play time means value. The worst offenders of straining minimal content to the point of boredom is the RPG. RPG games can linger on into the 100s of hours, while making the player do essentially the same things over and over again. Dark Souls likens itself to a RPG, but I think, at it&rsquo;s heart it is some other strange hybrid of action game, fighting game, and adventure game. Making an experience that last for 60 or more hours shouldn&rsquo;t really have been in the games mandate. At the time it was made the short length indie game had not yet caught on as a trend, so it would have been tough for them to sell the game as tight 10-20 hour experience that you can return to for its variety of play styles and fast, challenging combat. A price point of $30-$40 just wasn&rsquo;t an option. And so, they stretched. I&rsquo;ll be honest though, I don&rsquo;t know that I have ever played a game that did the stretch and the padding quite so expertly. Areas and enemies are always changing and varying well into the later hours of Dark Souls. Often there will be an enemy that you will encounter in an area that is complete unique, if not in behavior, then at least in appearance. The unqualified shit ton of art created for Dark Souls is absolutely staggering. But does that make the game better than a focused experience that gets to the point and wraps up in a reasonable amount of time. No, no it doesn&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I obviously enjoyed playing Dark Souls quite a bit, but I think there is something to be learned here about not creating games that overstay their welcome, or in this case, inch right up to that line and linger at the edge. &#8203;\t\t"

At the end of the game you fight a space baboon and maybe a ghost.In the Aero Fighters series, like other games of their type, you control a fighter jet firing exotic laser weaponry up the screen as sci-fi enemies plummet down toward you. It is a direct descendant of Space Invaders. There is probably no reason to include a story or characters in this type of game. The action consists mainly of winding your way through increasingly treacherous bullet patterns, and that could be enough. They could stop there. The developers of Aero Fighters chose instead to envelop all the preceding in thick ridiculous sauce while still playing it fairly straight. There is rarely any acknowledgement that a dolphin in a leather aviator helmet isn&rsquo;t the most natural thing in the world. They even include multiple endings based on the characters chosen. The game would be good without it, but it is the weird factor that pushes Aero Fighters, and particularly Aero Fighters 2, into the realm of the classics. You fight tanks, you fight walking robot tanks, you fight a baboon, and you can do it as a dolphin in a jet. Aero Fighters 2 is one of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

One was a CD, one was a cassette, but I don&rsquo;t remember which. The sensible move might have been to sell one copy, or give it to a friend, but that wasn&rsquo;t what I did. I kept the cd in the house and I took the tape out to the shop. The stereo I had out there was a tinny, scratchy little thing, but sound came out of it when tapes went into it, so it served my purposes. For a good long time, the only tapes that nestled into that little deck were Fully Completely, Pearl Jam&rsquo;s Ten, and maybe some Soundgarden.The shop, like a lot of farm buildings, is a large, rectangular, steel clad structure on a concrete pad. Unlike a lot of farm buildings, the shop is heated and, aside from an ever present whiff of &nbsp;gasoline and diesel fuel, fairly clean. In 1992, that is where the computer was. In 1992 that was where I would be. I would turn on the stereo, and play Wing Commander or X-Wing well into the night. Occasionally, well into the morning, Fully Completely on loop.When At the Hundredth Meridian comes on the radio, it still makes me think of flying though space.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI was thinking recently about the way I work on design problems. There are about as many ways of approaching and dealing with design problems as there are people who wrestle with them. Because of that, I have always felt that the usual tutorial style writeup people do of their work flow and habits was at best overly simplistic, and at worst blind to alternate solutions. For far too many people the contents of tutorials are taken as the definitive way to solve a problem or use a tool. I can think of few things more counterproductive than telling a creative person a definitive way to do something. As is my general policy, I will not do a tutorial. If anything I write is useful to you in your own work, we can call that a happy side effect.My own method, and as prescribed above I invite you to ignore in favor of yours, is often to work backward. Or outward, or inward, or occasionally sideways. When a design problem comes up, there is often one clear and obvious way to tackle it, but I often find that looking at it from another angle can lead to better solutions. I&rsquo;ll attempt to explain by describing a project I worked on a few years ago.I used to design and build signs. Many of the signs were already designed in the creative sense. That is, someone had designed the look and general aesthetic of the sign, and the task then for we, the sign manufacturing folk, was to figure out how to assemble that sign. Occasionally that was very simple and straightforward, for something standardized like a traffic sign. Other times it could be aggressively complex incorporating many materials, manufacturing methods, and specialized skills. I&rsquo;m not going to write about any of those. I&rsquo;m going to write about a measuring stick. Quite a few different sizes and shapes make up the wonderful world of traffic signs. Most of them are standardized to fit on the same poles and brackets. The holes are a set distance from the center of these signs, and a measuring tape is the most complex tool you would probably need to mark where those holes go. Of course, people being people, not all types of signs match that standard. Some have holes that are set wider or in a different pattern than straight up the center. Some holes need to be drilled vertical to the ground, some are horizontal to the ground, and some need to be drilled in both vertical and horizontal like a T or H shape. Rather than attempt to measure each one of the dozens and dozens of signs that are manufactured constantly, someone a long time ago decided that it would be more efficient to create some templates that you could simply lay over the sign you were marking for holes. You would lay the correct template down and mark the spots where the holes would go with a sharpie or a grease pencil. When you needed to mark another type of sign, you would go to the pile of templates, gather up the one that you needed, and make your marks. It was a pretty good system, and I couldn&rsquo;t really see any way to improve it.As with all tools, the templates had started to wear out. One of them had been broken and welded back together so it no longer laid perfectly flat. They were all made of pretty heavy steel, and some of them were U channel bars, so they were much thicker than a template really needs to be. The templates were in use long before I worked there, but their time had come, and since I operated the metal cutting router machine, I was tasked with replacing some of them. The first, simplest, solution was, of course, to replace the damaged ones with lighter aluminum versions and move on with life. Both the guy who was in charge of the templates and myself weren&rsquo;t really satisfied with that. There were a few templates that could easily be combined into one with some simple design work, so why not do away with the redundant templates, even the ones that were in good condition, to reduce the amount of different measuring tools in that pile. I drew that up in whatever vector program was handy, likely illustrator but I really can&rsquo;t recall, and it was quickly apparent that we could fit a few more of the templates into this design. We did that, and figured we were done. There were a couple more large H shaped templates, but adding those to the design of this new template would make the whole thing unreasonably large and heavy, sort of defeating the whole point of recreating the templates in the first place. I got to work creating the one, roughly rectangular, template, and the several outlier versions that would become slightly lighter and less massive after the redesign, but only slightly. That should have been it. Replace the old tools with new tools that, with the exception of a few, would be roughly the same. The pile would go from 5 or 6 different templates to 3 or 4, but you would still need to measure several of the sign blanks and mark the center so that the template would line up properly. That&rsquo;s when I started to look at the problem from the inside out rather than just base my work on what already existed.Working from the inside out, I came up with an idea for a cross shaped template, rather than one that matched the perimeter of the standard signs. Since the holes ran up the centers of the signs, you really only needed the center of the template. The rest of the material was superfluous. I set out creating a plus sign a few feet across that had stepped sides. The different steps would line up with the different sign dimensions so you would never have to measure to find the center. Lining up the steps to the edge of the blank piece of aluminum with your fingers would be enough. All but the H shaped brackets could be included in this design and it would massively simplify the templates pile. It wasn&rsquo;t very far into the design process that we realized that only the location of the holes was important in the H shaped template. Adding a ring with holes at the appropriate points to the cross shaped template wouldn&rsquo;t add much weight, and it would maintain roughly the same dimensions. The ring also worked as a nice carrying handle when you needed to move the template from place to place. I cut one out on the router and it worked pretty well. Actually, it worked so well that the department that actually goes out and installs the signs onto signposts snagged it for their trucks. Rather than cart around the several templates that they had, they could carry this one light and durable template for any sign they need to install or repair. I made another for the sign shop, incorporating some tweaks that we had come up with, and someone else created a color coded chart and stickers for the template. Now if someone was operating the hole punch and was unsure what set of holes was for what type of sign, they could simply consult the chart displayed above the templates storage location.All in all, it wasn&rsquo;t a particularly sophisticated solution to a design problem. It didn&rsquo;t take a lot of engineering or complex math. I think the end result is pleasing to look at, but only because the tool excels at its one job, showing you where to make holes. I&rsquo;m not sure if they have made more of them for the folks on the installation trucks, or made changes to the design to refine and add to it, but I was happy that it worked. Rather than just replace what existed with slightly improved versions, looking at the problem in another way resulted in a better functioning and simplified tool. Whenever I am faced with a problem that seems like the solution might be a bit clunky, I always remember that measuring stick, and how working the problem from the inside out made for a better product.          The template can be seen leaning against the wall behind the metal punch. The color coded chart (KPP Chart) is on the wall above.&nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWe are all playing Pokemon Go here. What of it there is to play. The experience of Pokemon Go could be described as thin. The game consists primarily of going for a walk and getting interrupted. That may not sound particularly fun but that would be missing the point. What Pokemon Go offers is wish fulfilment.The original Pokemon games were simple RPG games made for kids between the ages of around 8 to 15. You would walk your character around a few small towns in a fictional land searching out and capturing all sorts of imaginary animals. You then train your new pets for combat and pit them against other cute animals. You know, like kids do. An awful lot of kids explored that fictional world. They combed every square inch trying to find a Squirtle or a Kadabra, but they did it largely alone, and on a screen. I wasn&rsquo;t the right age when Pokemon hit North America full force so it never really resonated with me, but the idea that you could walk around your own town or your own neighborhood with your friends to search for those same fictional creatures was the stuff of daydreams for a lot of kids. A lot of kids that are now grown into adults. Still, childhood daydreams endure, and gathering cute imaginary animals remains an attractive pursuit.Sure Pokemon Go is a simplistic game, and the gym battles miss out on a lot of the strategic depth that could be found in the original, turn based, combat system, but it delivers wish fulfilment in spades. With the promise of augmented reality games like Pokemon Go, or more theme park styled, location based, virtual reality games, it makes me wonder what other daydreams could be made real. &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Star Trek : 25th Anniversary and Star Trek : Judgement RitesThere is a theory floating around that the music you listen to during your mid to late teens will shape your musical taste for the rest of your life. Some pattern of rhythms and tones gets etched directly into the topography of your brain, and any new music that fits that imprint will be much more appealing. If that&rsquo;s true, and if it applies to media other than music, I have a Star Trek shaped valley in my brain. My uncle would record Star Trek onto VHS tapes, label, organize, and store them in an end table cabinet. Netflix for me in 1990 was a VCR and every episode of Star Trek that had ever aired. I have watched all of the original series, Next Generation, and Deep Space Nine several times over. Voyager and Enterprise to a lesser extent, but I still found things to enjoy in those shows.Video Games have a tendency to lean on the action and combat aspects of any other fiction that they adapt. It makes sense really. The typical input method of video games is joystick and button, and pressing a button doesn&rsquo;t exactly lend itself to expressing the moral and intellectual grist of your average episode of Star Trek. The tools the player usually has to affect a game world are blunt and destructive. Shooting, punching, kicking, smashing, stabbing, are all a mainstay of video games, and none of them are really a big apart of Star Trek. To be fair, Star Trek has a lot of space battles and punching, but all of that violence happens when diplomacy ends and intelligence fails. There is always a cost for violence in Star Trek. Most of the video game adaptations of Star Trek focus on combat, and it never feels right. These Star Trek themed combat games don&rsquo;t fit in my Star Trek shaped hole.Star Trek : 25th Anniversary and Star Trek : Judgement Rites are point and click adventure games. They tell tightly scripted stories and offer up simple puzzles for you to solve. The puzzles are fairly simple by adventure game standards, but they are logical and depend on a fair bit of character interaction and dialog. The characters from the original series are well represented, and even voiced by most of the original actors, even if they do phone in the performances. The games are broken up into several bite sized adventures that all begin with a title card and a captain's log voiceover or some other similar lead in technique lifted directly from the show. The games are designed to feel like the show, which goes a long way, but that isn&rsquo;t what really makes them resonate as Star Trek.At every step, these adventure games emphasize the use of intelligence and diplomacy over the use of force. They are written so that the characters and their interactions are more important than the mysteries being solved. The themes for each episode are high concept sci fi tropes, and occasionally a bit thin, but they make a good backdrop for Spock and McCoy&rsquo;s brotherly bickering. If you can manage it, peaceful and clever solutions to every adventure will garner more rewards, and more importantly, keep your crew safe and your red shirts alive. Other than Sam and Max Hit the Road, I think that Star Trek : 25th Anniversary might be the only adventure game that I have ever finished without ever looking up a single hint. Maybe that is because the game was quite easy or short, but I think it just felt so much like Star Trek that I was compelled to keep playing just to see what the characters would say and do next. My adolescence has probably hardwired me to enjoy Star Trek in the same way as I enjoy Soundgarden songs, but I think I can still say that these are a couple of the best games.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tAfter a while away from it, I returned to development and programming this week. That inevitably lead to trying to figure out what the hell it was I was doing. I find that going back to old code is like trying to read the mind of a completely different person, and that person is an idiot. Even with good comments and careful organization it usually takes a while to get back into my previous headspace. This time, like so many others, I went through the code and when I finally figured out how it all worked, I wondered what would ever have made me think that it was the best way to do things. This leads to a disassembly of the old procedures and routines, and a replacement with a much simpler, much more stable versions that accomplish the same thing. Of course the old version worked too, just not as well and less elegantly. So there is the problem. I have heard time and time again never refactor code until it is feature complete. I can see the value in that. Why fix what isn&rsquo;t broken. I&rsquo;m not really a programmer, and I haven&rsquo;t learned, or been taught, why a lot of best practices became best practices. There are probably some very good reasons why the notion of never refactoring is so pervasive.I am a sculptor though, and I have found that if the skeleton of your work is weak, no amount of polish will ever correct those problems on the surface. If the structural forms of a model or drawing aren&rsquo;t solid, it will never turn out as well as you would like. I think that either programmers and artists just approach problems differently, or the idea of holding off on refactoring has been grossly overstated. As a sculptor or fabricator, I will likely to continue to work on creating a strong base, since it seems to be serving me well in the artistic field. This is one of those posts where I sort of ramble about what I am thinking, and nothing of note ever gets resolved or accomplished. Due to that, I have removed some of the more rambly bits to keep this one a bit shorter. Have a good day.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of 3D modelling recently. Making 3D models with the intent of running those digital files through a 3D printer and turning them into physical objects. There is a slightly different mindset required for objects that are intended for the real world. Games and video allow you to get away with a lot of nastyness that reality just isn&rsquo;t well suited for. Like gravity. Gravity is a thing that you have to deal with in the real world. Also, objects can&rsquo;t usually pass clean through other objects without at least one of them becoming a broken object. You know, technical stuff. Joking aside, 3D printers are incredible inventions that let you relatively quickly produce custom objects in your home, and more importantly, produce copies and iterations on that object. Sure, clay might predate humans by a fair bit, but if you sculpt something from clay, or wax, or butter, you will have to do exactly the same amount of work to make another one. With a 3D printer it will only take more time, not more work. So why isn&rsquo;t everyone using a 3D printer? They sort of suck.There are a lot of nerds out there touting the 3D printing revolution, fewer now that the bloom is off, but still more than I would expect. Here is the main problem, and the reason why the 3D printing revolution is a ways off yet. Nerds have fun differently. I have worked at a few places operating CNC machines. Those are the type of machine that you always see on How It&rsquo;s Made casually milling a car wheel out of a solid aluminum disk. They usually have to be enclosed in some sort of ballistic plastic chamber and they have a milk like coolant sprayed on them non stop. They look loud, fast, and dangerous, and they are, but operating them is also mind numbingly methodical, repetitive, and technical. All things that nerds love and everyone else cuts across the room to avoid. They are not what you would call user friendly.3D printers operate almost exactly the same way as those CNC machines, instead of a high velocity cutting tool or welding tool attached to it, you have a high class hot glue gun. The glue gun portion melts some plastic line and squeezes it through a tiny hole. The plastic quickly cools down and hardens into whatever shape you had the moving around parts draw out. It does this one layer of plastic at a time until a 3 dimensional shape is a built. It is all at once, ridiculously simple and remarkably precise. The quality of the product of that process is either amazing, or terrible, depending entirely on your point of view. It is a great way to prototype and test, but you would never in a million years mistake a 3D printed part for a cheap mass produced object created in an industrial injection mold. They just look better than the 3D printed objects. For a revolution to happen, 3D printing would have to be high quality, fast, and user friendly. It is none of those things. Machines are available now that inch us closer to the first two, but that last one, user friendly, that just isn&rsquo;t possible. Attempting to create software that makes the end to end process of 3D modelling, setting the model up for print and running a motion program on the printer to create the object, would completely squander the promise of these machines. You can create new versions of objects, with tweaks and alterations, but all of that takes work. Work carried out in non-user friendly software using sometimes unintuitive workflows. It&rsquo;s not impossible, it might not even be that hard, but it takes work. Specifically methodical, repetitive, and technical work. The sort of work that a lot of nerds, myself included, enjoy. Since we find these things fun, we wrongly assume that other people will find it fun too, and that leads to people saying dumb things, like 3D printing is a revolution in product design and manufacturing, and even dumber, everyone will have one in their home. There you go. Unless you are one of the nerdy few who enjoy messing with stuff that will probably never really work right, don&rsquo;t get a 3D printer. To all of you who actually read this far, welcome to this exclusive and sorta stupid club. Let print some junk. &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Puzzle Bobble / Bust a Move / Puzzle De Pon / etc.&#8203;The match three bubble shooters have gone by many names and many numerals, but &ldquo;Balls&rdquo; is of course the common shorthand adopted by most players. Accepting how pervasive and ever present the genre has become, it is conceivable that we will reach a day when all games will be, at least partly, Balls.No one knows how long ago the bubble shooting genre began. Some say it started with the Romans, casting javelins at inflated animal bladders arranged in brightly colored groups of three. Some say that cave walls in northern spain clearly depict a collision of three circles, one having bounced off a wall using simple physics. There are even cosmologists that suggest that Bubble matching could be a model for the early universe, newly born particles being fired from a cannon manned by two cartoon dinosaur children. One thing is for certain, the shooting of bubbles and the matching of three similar types is as much a part of our present and future as it is our past. All hail Bub and Bob! Balls!Bubble shooting games represent both types of children, transformed into bubble dragons or zodiac tarot card, so no matter who you are these games hold up a mirror to your life. Couple that with the moving tale of a bubble just trying to return to it&rsquo;s family only to burst at the meeting. Balls invites reflection.Bouncing things is fun. Puzzle de Pon is better than Puzzle Bobble. There I said it. Both are the best games. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI played Dodgeball today. Dodgeball is, to put it succinctly, uncomplicated. As names go, few are more descriptive than Dodgeball. The particulars of the game don&rsquo;t actually extend much further see a ball, now dodge that ball. Left out of the title is that you then pick up a ball and make someone else dodge that ball. And thus, what at first might have been an assault becomes a game. I have also been playing video games, and almost none of them can be called uncomplicated. Gamepads are the customary form of interacting with a video game and they are not in the same time zone as uncomplicated. If you wanted to operate all of the possible buttons and stick you would need a phalanx of thumbs, each with four or five extra joints. If you didn&rsquo;t grow up with gamepads I have to believe that they would be terrifying devices to pick up and hold. It must be like attempting to operate a nuclear sub, in russian. There are all these bright objects to poke at, and you don&rsquo;t know which one will destroy you. Early video games used a single joystick, or even a knob that only spins clockwise and counterclockwise. Maybe, just maybe, there is a button on there too. A single button. It&rsquo;s pressed or it is not pressed. See, uncomplicated. I&rsquo;ll quickly get this out there. Before this becomes a rant on how things were back in my day and blah blah blah, I&rsquo;ll have to explain myself. I love complex controls for games. I can really get into a game that requires me to use every button on the controller in smart and precise ways. The digital gymnastics demanded of the later levels of Guacamelee was a great fun challenge. SSX only really gets going when you start resting fingers on all four shoulder buttons. Wing Commander and Tie Fighter use much of your keyboard along with a good flightstick, preferably one with a pinky switch, and those aren&rsquo;t even real hardcore flight sims. What I&rsquo;m saying though, is that I am not the majority. I am a weird outlier, and I know it. Most &ldquo;core&rdquo; gamers are. We shouldn&rsquo;t be the ones that dictate the complexity of control schemes. The Wii was a massive success, primarily due to how friendly the controls were. Telling someone that they could participate in a reasonable, hand drawn, facsimile of bowling in their house, and they would only be expected to operate one button to do it, has the effect of inviting a lot of new people to the medium. What they quickly discovered was that people who want to bowl in their house aren&rsquo;t really the same people who will play Mario Galaxy or Goldeneye. They just want to bowl. There are as many variants of Dodgeball as there are groups of people who play it. New rules, new court configurations, new limitations. They all compound the difficulty of the game, and the ramp up time for new players. But new players to Dodgeball don&rsquo;t learn all the more complicated rules the first time out on the court. They dodge a ball, then they pick up and throw a ball. That&rsquo;s it. Any additional complexity to the game can be added one slow rule at a time. Soon you are playing 5 a side dodgeball in a circular court with shot clocks and opportunities for eliminated players to return or help strategically from the sidelines. It is a completely different game than just dodging a ball, but the way you got there was so organic that you might never have noticed. Video games too often try to invent entirely new schemes and dynamics to take advantage of all the mechanics of a modern gamepad. Some folks just want to bowl. With the new VR headsets there are a couple new controllers that, at first glance, seem to work very much like the Wii controllers did. Simply and intuitively you move them around in front of you and maybe you press one or two buttons. You can probably put together a mean game of bowling in VR.Now what if, instead of developing a new and complicated finger dance for your new, hot, VR shooter game, you just started with bowling, or lobbing, or pointing, and worked players up to something deeper, denser, and more fun. A bowling adventure game, where you can simply stay and bowl in your house if you would like, but provide a broader experience for the player willing to go there. Make these games a jumping off point for the person who would otherwise never have bought another game because they were satisfied with only bowling. There is a built in, but limited, audience that will get the new Legend of Zelda game, but could there be a huge audience for a Bowling of Zelda game. We might never know. Video games are still developed for specific audiences, with specific tolerances to almost arbitrary complexity, and there is no real effort being made to invite new people to come and play.Going from school gym Dodgeball to a competitive sport like basketball, or water polo, is only a matter of small accumulated rule changes. Where video games are concerned, I went through those small changes slowly over years and many different games. Currently, I&rsquo;m afraid the only way to really get into video games, is probably to start when you are young enough that you don&rsquo;t know any other way. You don&rsquo;t know that what you are being asked to overcome just to enjoy a game is unfair and counter to the way people have been learning and sharing games for centuries. In the quest to serve the &ldquo;core gamer&rdquo;, we have mostly abandoned how and why games attract new players.Maybe we will figure it out again, maybe we won&rsquo;t. Either way, dodgeball is still a great game. &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Virtua FighterIf you walked into an arcade in the early 90&rsquo;s you would have seen a solid wall of cabinets all containing one game, Street Fighter 2. There might even have been many different versions of Street Fighter 2.&nbsp;Street Fighter 2: The World Warrior, the game that kicked off a new era in fighting games. Street Fighter 2: Champion Edition let you play as the boss characters from the first version and introduced mirror matches that let two&nbsp;players fight as palette swapped copies of the same character. Street Fighter 2 Turbo: Hyper Fighting sped up&nbsp;the game, added new character moves, and rebalanced the whole shebang for better competitive play. Street Fighter 2: Rainbow Edition was a hacked bootleg of one of the previous games that could have any number of tweaks and twists that made the fighting flat out goofy and unpredictable. There may have even been Super Street Fighter 2, a game with new characters, completely redone graphics and sound, and new sets of moves for the entire roster. It wouldn&rsquo;t even be uncommon for there to be a couple copies of each game. Not only could there be a solid dozen cabinets all sporting Street Fighter 2, but odds were good that they would all be in use. That was an arcade in the early 90&rsquo;s. All hadoukens, all the time.Of course Street Fighter wouldn&rsquo;t be the only game in there, just most of them. Off in the one of the less populated corners of the place would be another fighting game. It would only use three buttons rather than the Street Fighter 2 six buttons or the Mortal Kombat five buttons. Seemingly, not enough possible inputs for a fighting game with a rich set of moves. The characters looked like people shaped pinatas made from serrated construction paper. All flat faces and jagged edges. Compared to the beautiful hand painted animation of games like Street Fighter 2, Virtua Fighter was unquestionably ugly. Ugly and strange. In still shots, the game looked awful, but in motion Virtua Fighter sang.Released a couple of years before the first Toy Story, the real time 3D graphics of Virtua Fighter were an unknown quantity. Where movies, television shows, and commercials could devote the time and budget to render all of the glossy effects and characters slowly, one small patch of pixels at a time, real time games need to draw the whole screen once every 30th or, for a fighting game, 60th of a second. That isn&rsquo;t enough time to render one leaf in A Bug&rsquo;s Life. Given those limitations, Virtua Fighter can be forgiven for looking sort of ugly. The way the characters moved was the furthest thing from ugly. Street Fighter 2 adopted an animation style of held frames followed by rapid motion and short, cycled movements. The whole game feels snappy and precise. Virtua Fighter is fluid. All of the characters take on a martial artist dance like quality as punch, kick, block, and jump actions flow one into the next. Street Fighter 2 pits a collection of anime wizards in staccato combat, throwing balls of energy across the screen, breathing fire, or excreting lightning. Virtua Fighter moves like Jackie Chan choreography, close up and visceral. The hits land like cannon fire, but smoothly defending, countering, and chaining blows can feel almost elegant. All the while the camera dynamically&nbsp;swoops and glides to frame the action.The transition to 3D graphics was not entirely flawless, but it proved what was possible when character movements are comprised of a sequence of mathematical probabilities, rather than pre-drawn images. The game simulation becomes reactive to player input rather than pulling from a grab bag of predetermined drawings on a millisecond to millisecond basis. This game that, on the face of it, was ugly, could actually feel more alive and immediate than the dozens of other games that lined the walls of a 90&rsquo;s arcade. Virtua Fighter is one of the best games.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tIt&rsquo;s E3 time again. I frickin&rsquo; love E3 and I have no idea why. I get excited for the conferences and the trailers and the reveals and the gaffs and the press reactions and everything from the show floor. It makes no sense. I&rsquo;m currently playing a game that is 5 years old, and after that I&rsquo;ll probably play a game that is only two or three years old. My urge to be up to date on the goings on in the game industry is not in lock step with how up to date I am on actual games. I used to think that meant I was out of touch. Now I think it&rsquo;s great.There was a time in the early 90s when being a gamer meant that you played pretty much everything. There were a lot of games being made, but you could reasonably dabble in every available genre. You could sample all of the types and styles of experiences being worked on. There were many samey clones of tentpole games, but if you played one of them, you got the gist of the rest. Not so much anymore. Even given unlimited time, or a profession that revolved solely around playing new games, it would be physically impossible to play, or even know about, all of the games coming out. There are too many, on too many platforms, with too many requirements.There has been a lot of chatter about the bursting of this bubble and that bubble. The indiepocalypse, the downfall of mobile, the mid tier crash, the shrinking of AAA. All of it is bunk. What part of indie is collapsing, is it the part where people put small projects up on itch.io? &nbsp;Is it the garage developer with three titles? Is it the large budget, but laser focus of something like The Witness? What indie bubble is doing the bursting? There are just too many of them. Mobile is failing? What part? The small compulsive game, the collectible card game, the touch controlled adventure? Again there are just too many. There is no one class of game that can be dubbed triple A, just like there is no one group of indie games. The real issue is this. There are fewer and fewer massive blockbusters. There are less and less giant hits. There are no other Minecrafts. That isn&rsquo;t a sign of a collapse. That is a sign of maturity. There are so many games available, that people can and will be choosey about what they play. Studios betting everything on a runaway hit has never been a great idea, it&rsquo;s just less so now. Steady business that funds development of the next game, and the next game, and the next game, is the best that can be hoped for. Congrats, game industry. That&rsquo;s called sustainable business. I will watch this year's E3 coverage and get excited about all the new announcements. Over the next few years I will play a tiny fraction of those games, and that will be fine. Each of those games will have it&rsquo;s audience and many of them will earn a modest return. Enough for that studio to make a new game, or maybe two smaller games. Universal acclaim will become more and more difficult to attain, but overall, more people will find real, steady, and fulfilling employment making games. We haven&rsquo;t reached any sort of apocalypse yet, not by a long shot. &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI stopped reading a book this week. Not finished, just stopped. This book had come to me well recommended, and it was in a genre that I enjoy but hadn&rsquo;t read in quite some time, so I was interested. I really wanted to like it. I was rooting for this book, but I just can&rsquo;t find it in myself to read one more leaden passage. Of course, putting down a book is not really an event worth noting. I don&rsquo;t feel moved to commit a feverish, gnashing review of the thing. It just wasn&rsquo;t very good. Hardly a crime. The ways in which this particular book failed to engage me, though, that was interesting. Reading just part of it has taught me some very important lessons about writing.Just previous, I had finished Cormac McCarthy&rsquo;s The Road. In place of any grander review of that book I&rsquo;ll just say this. While I don&rsquo;t believe I agree with the author&rsquo;s world view here, I do think that The Road is a well written book. McCarthy has written a story that I find actively off putting in a lot of ways. Not the context of a post apocalyptic world, but his implied assumptions about the inherent darkness of human nature. Even with that, I kept reading, and actually enjoyed the book. The deftness of the writing carried the lurching pace and strained allegory. It was a good book, perhaps in spite of itself. Funny enough, the book that I put down has almost the exact same aggregate review scores as The Road, so there are a lot of people out there that really like it. It took me several chapters to zero in on what was bothering me. When I finally got it, I knew I could safely stop reading and move on. It might be shockingly obvious to everyone else, but I hadn&rsquo;t really realized that fiction in writing, just like in movies, is all about show, don&rsquo;t tell. Maybe I realized it, I just didn&rsquo;t appreciate the degree to which showing and not telling effected written works. That was the wall. That was my problem with this book. I was constantly being told what characters were thinking, and why, but I was never reading any descriptions of them actually doing things. Reading about them doing things in a way that reveals something important about their inner life without explicitly describing that thought process. Maybe that tell don&rsquo;t show sort of writing really works for some people, and the reader reviews seem to indicate that it does, but I bounced off that book incredibly hard. I think I needed the sharp contrast between reading a book that I enjoyed, but had problems with the narrative, and reading a book that in summary sounds like something I would love, but just couldn&rsquo;t get through due to how the story was being told. Now, I don&rsquo;t know that this one moment of slight understanding will do anything to improve my own writing, but I have to figure that every little bit helps. Regardless, I&rsquo;m happy to state that it took reading a bad book to make me understand good writing. &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWe don&rsquo;t celebrate our heroes. The people who make games, we don&rsquo;t celebrate them. Not in the way that we should. Oh we celebrate the games well enough. You would be hard pressed to dredge up a human that doesn&rsquo;t know who Mario is. Hum a few bars of Super Mario Bros. theme music among strangers, and someone will probably start humming along with you. At the very least you will have put that song in their head for the rest of the day. Games, at least those particular games, have permeated popular culture to that point. Now ask that same person who wrote that music, and they probably won&rsquo;t know. Now ask the same person who Kurt Cobain is. Ask them who Paul McCartney is. Kurt Cobain wrote some good songs, but nothing that will stick with you like a Koji Kondo tune. Paul McCartney wrote some of the most instantly recognizable music from the last couple hundred years. The exact same can be said of Koji Kondo. The music from Legend of Zelda can evoke four emotions from you simultaneously while you gladly listen to it for six hours straight. Koji Kondo is an artist to celebrate, yet to the majority of the public, he is invisible. There was an announcement of a new movie being manufactured based on Tetris. Tetris. Now before you say &ldquo;How can anyone make a movie about Tetris? How can this simple geometric puzzle game become a movie? It doesn&rsquo;t even have a story!&rdquo; There is one, exactly one, tremendous movie to made about Tetris, and it has absolutely nothing to do with the game. It is the story of a humble, cherubic computer programmer working as a researcher in the Soviet Union during the late days of the cold war. It is the story of a dynamic Dutch-American polyglot game developer working deals in europe, Russia, North america, and Japan.The movie would be about Alexey Pajitnov and Henk Rogers.The Tetris movie would be a dozen other small human stories about the bizarre dealings of Soviet bureaucrats, dynastic Japanese family businesses, and the adolescence of a juggernaut industry. &nbsp;The actual game, Tetris, would be relegated to a plot device. As it Should be. The Tetris movie would be about people.For an art form that used to redact the names of the creators as a standard practice, the video game industry has taken great strides in recognizing artistic and creative talent with awards shows and the like, but they tend to be a lot of preaching to the choir. The Audience that likes to know about the people who make games will watch those shows, and that&rsquo;s about it. There is something to be said about formalizing the respect of peers, but it does little to legitimize games as an important part of culture. Respect requires recognition. Recognition of the people who create games, not recognition of the games themselves. Games, after all, are just products and they don&rsquo;t really give a flying fart who likes them. People who create great works of popular culture deserve some recognition. We should celebrate our heroes.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI&rsquo;ve been playing a lot of Dark Souls recently. Not the new one. No 2 or 3, just plain old Dark Souls. I could write about why I am really enjoying it, or why I think that other people should play it, but that would be just add to the cacophony of hyperbole and fanboy love for this game. Exactly the sort of stuff that makes people not want to play a game. The sort of stuff that made me avoid it for this long. When Demon&rsquo;s Souls came out, I didn&rsquo;t have a PS3, and my second kid had just been born. Playing any game, let alone that game, for any length of time was just not happening. People raved about Demon&rsquo;s Souls, but I had played some King&rsquo;s Field, found it unbearably dull, and hearing that Demon&rsquo;s Souls was the spiritual successor to King&rsquo;s Field snuffed out any flicker of interest.I have a harsh reflexive sense for when a game doesn&rsquo;t respect my time. Walking for hours to hit a save point, or dealing with forced waves of enemies before you can advance to a new area have always seemed like really hack moves. Having kids has only strengthened this reflex. I&rsquo;m not talking about long games. Games that take time, but build and move as you play them are some of the best experiences I have had playing games. As long as they let you drive the pace of the experience.I have never been more frustrated with a game than when I was dealing with the save system in Resident Evil 4. Even if you know exactly where every enemy is and how to deal with them some of the stretches between areas in Resident Evil 4 can take more than half an hour. That&rsquo;s not tension building.That&rsquo;s garbage. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that I really liked Resident Evil 4, but for all the good, it just does not respect the player. I picked up Dark Souls a few years ago on one of the steep Steam sales. I tried it once, but didn&rsquo;t really understand the save system and feared that I had just entered into a new Resident Evil 4 situation. I figured that, while other people might enjoy it, it probably isn&rsquo;t for me.The common rhetoric about the Souls games is that they are very difficult, but fair. What I have never heard is how much this game respects the player. The player drives the experience. Want to play for fifteen minutes, that&rsquo;s fine. Want to play for seven hours, sure go ahead. Both experiences will move the game forward. Want to spend a long time in one area, not a problem. You can still make progress. There is never a time when you feel like the game is holding up your ability to play it.I thought that this game was something that it is not. I might have said something stupid recently like &ldquo;Dark Souls isn&rsquo;t hard, it&rsquo;s just one of the most videogame, videogames.&rdquo; Which is to say, you play it. It might have been stupid, but I meant it.So, if there is anyone else out there who is sick of hearing about how wonderful these games are, but are afraid of brutal time sinks, the majority of what you hear is not what this game is about. There might be deep mysterious lore, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter. The setting and spectacle is stunning, but not core to the experience. The game might be difficult, but it doesn&rsquo;t just throw any random luck based nonsense at you and the penalty for dying is mostly symbolic. You can play it for a long time, but you aren&rsquo;t required to spend time playing it. If there are any game design takeaways from Dark Souls, it should be how much it respects the player. It respects you to the point that it expects you to drive the experience. It expects you to play when you want and how you want. It is one of the most videogame, videogames.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games Worst Game - Sonic ShuffleWhen I started writing these best games bits, I said that I wouldn’t try to do any snarky takedowns of awful games. While being clever and humorous might be difficult, hating on things is easy and not interesting. Pretending to hate things to prove your ‘cred’ is one of the more terrible aspects of human nature, so I made a conscious effort to avoid doing that. That said, there is some value in defining the bounds of the scale. Sonic Shuffle is the worst game I have ever played.When I write one of these, I usually track down the game I am writing about and give it a quick once over. I’ll play it again for a few minutes, refresh my memory with some research, and collect my own thoughts on the game while trying to avoid other reviews and perspectives. Not this time. I could go and fetch the disc from the plastic bin it calls home, and I could either hook up one of the two dreamcasts in there with it, or attempt to run it on an emulator. I could search youtube for a commentary free playthrough of Sonic Shuffle. I could search out a review from the time that the game came out. I just couldn’t muster the interest. I couldn’t bring myself to devote more time than it takes to write this post. Sonic Shuffle hasn’t earned that.There are a lot of games that are terrible. Some are broken messes. Some control poorly. Some are just plain boring. I guarantee you this, no matter how boring you think a game is, it is a goddamn rollercoaster compared to Sonic Shuffle. Zork is a rock concert shooting fireworks over a monster truck rodeo compared to Sonic Shuffle. If there was a game development flow chart where every branching path had an option to take more time and do less with it, Sonic Shuffle followed every single one of those. I have had more fun creating an Excel spreadsheet than with this example of entertainment software. That’s not a joke. That’s literally true.Sonic Shuffle purports to be a party game, so maybe I would have had more fun with it if I had played it with a group of friends. That won’t happen. I like my friends, and watching them slide off a couch into a pile of disinterested disgust doesn’t appeal to me.You might notice that I haven’t really gone into the card based mechanics of the game or the variety of minigames. The overarching mechanic is Nim as a multiplayer game. If the game succeeds anywhere, it is proving that Nim doesn’t work with more than 2 players. Go look it up yourself if you are interested. I won’t. I’m already bored from typing that sentence.There you go. Now you know where the bottom of the scale lies. If I play a game that I don’t really like, I can always think “is it worse than Sonic Shuffle”. I can honestly say that nothing in the 40 plus year history of videogames is.Sonic Shuffle is the worst game. Probably ever.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tMy favorite superhero is Spider-Man. It may have been the late 60s cartoon series or the late 70s comic books, but either way, I was very young when I was first introduced to Spider-Man. Something about the character has always appealed to me. It took me a very long time put my finger on exactly what.Spider-Man is one of the most famous superheroes. Right up there with Batman, but very different from the usual superhero archetype. Spider-Man is powerful, fast, idealistic, cocky, smart, witty, and pure of heart. All the things you want in your heroes. He is also contemplative, unsure of himself, clumsy, intimidated, awkward, shy, and frightened. &nbsp;When Peter Parker puts on the Spider-Man costume, he is attempting to hide not only his face, but all of the things he is feeling. In the hands of the best writers, Spider-Man becomes the analogue of the messy internal turmoil that storms in everyone. His human frailties, more often than not, creep into his superhero persona. Both Peter Parker and Spider-Man&rsquo;s struggles are more internal than external. More so than Mysterio and Vulture, Spider-Man&rsquo;s villains are self doubt, and fear of failure. I sum it up this way. Spider-Man represents everything that you are, and everything that you want to be.We recently took a family trip to DisneyLand. My kids feel like they are getting a little too old to participate in the Jedi Academy show that they put on in the Tomorrowland area, but we had a little time the one day, so I headed over to watch. Either I never got too old, or I rounded the corner and no longer have any bearing on what I am too old for. If you haven&rsquo;t seen it, the setup is this. About 30 kids sign up to participate in each performance as Jedi Padawan. The previous show had the kids go through a quick training instruction delivered by the Jedi masters before they battled back Star Wars villains using their new lightsaber skills. Darth Vader would stomp around the stage and act menacing, the kids would fight him, win, and everyone had a good time.The show now, is a bit different. 30 or so children are marched in wearing Jedi robes accompanied by swelling John Williams music and led by charismatic performers playing the Jedi masters. That much is the same. This time though, they have created a simple story to explain the proceedings. All of the remaining Jedi are on the run from nefarious forces and they have come across the refuge of an ancient Jedi temple. To enter the temple they will have to face the manifestation of their fears. Spectres of evil Star Wars characters will emerge and they will use the same lightsaber fencing moves as in previous versions of the show to defeat them.If that was all that was changed, I wouldn&rsquo;t have really had any response to the show. It would be a simple pantomime set in the Star Wars mythos for young kids to enjoy. They have added one very important twist to the production. There is now a running commentary between the level headed Jedi master and his adept but excitable apprentice. The master keeps telling the kids that they are facing off against their fears and that it is their bravery, not their lightsaber skills that will get them through this trial. The apprentice, of course, struggles with this. During the final minutes of the show, the apprentice, an adult who has led these 30 children through their drills of blocking, dodging, and striking, lets her fear get the better of her. Her fears are portrayed by a legitimately intimidating Kylo Ren. It comes as no surprise to all the adults present, that with the help of all the children she overcomes her fear and succeeds by not fighting at all. The conflict was, after all, an internal one. This is standard moralistic fare. The type of stories we have all become accustomed to. It would be very easy to dismiss this simple play as children's entertainment, devoid of complexity and maturity. Simple or not, when I watched as thirty small hands reached forward to force push away the legitimately frightening menace on the stage, it made me well up a little. What would have been simply a fun half hour activity at a theme park, may shape some kids world view, if even in a small way. The same small ways that myths and stories have shaped us since people have been telling them. Out of thirty kids, comprised roughly half girls and half boys, I hope that at least one in that group found their Spider-Man.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tShortly after the release of the Nintendo 64, I rented one and brought it home. I told anyone that would listen that this dark grey, swooped rectangle represented the most powerful graphics processing machine that you could sensibly buy for your living room. There were PC graphics cards, and specialty high end workstation components, of course, that would run shaded polygonal rings around the N64, but they ranged in price from several hundred to several thousand dollars. Here was a machine that was purpose built for drawing triangles to a screen as fast as possible, and it cost around $200. The N64 was hamstrung in pretty much every other way a computer can be. Not enough memory, outdated software storage, and proprietary everything. Since Nintendo had control of the machine from top to bottom, they could make it do things that seemed to sidestep those limitations. The dismal quality of many third party games proved that maybe Nintendo didn&rsquo;t really like to share it&rsquo;s secrets. It hurt the system, and kneecapped the spread of that particular hardware, capable as it was, to other computers and application. Things in the game industry were changing from hardware centric software design, that tried to squeeze the most performance out of the actual chips, to API and driver centric design. This meant that game developers (or any software developer really) would write their game to talk to an intermediate layer that sits between their application and the actual hardware. A game developer could be less and less concerned with how a specific graphics or CPU chip worked, and focus on OpenGL or DirectX. Those API&rsquo;s would then in turn be expected to deal with the wide variety of graphics and sound chips available. OpenGL and DirectX were nascent products and they weren&rsquo;t always reliable, but software is not static like hardware is, so massive improvements came quickly. It wasn&rsquo;t long before using a particular graphics card and a modified driver let a pretty standard PC emulate the Nintendo 64. The industry had moved on, and it wasn&rsquo;t the hardware, but the software that pushed everything forward.The current generation of consoles, namely the Xbox One and the Playstation 4, are headed toward mid cycle hardware upgrades. It will be a new, up to date, version of the same console at the same, or similar, price point. Just faster. Typically a change like this in a console would warrant a new name and some new gimmick to let consumers know that this console is worth the upgrade. Internally, the Xbox One and the Playstation 4 are PCs. Purpose built versions of off the shelf hardware fit for a low to mid tier gaming computer. They can&rsquo;t compete with the top of the line Nvidia or AMD PC chips, but they are by no means underpowered. One high end Nvidia card also costs twice what one of the consoles costs, and that is before you even put the rest of the computer around it. I have read a lot of comments that the consoles are lagging behind, but price to performance, they are extremely impressive. More importantly, the hardware doesn&rsquo;t really matter. The PS4 runs a Unix type OS and uses an API layer that, by all accounts, closely resembles DirectX. The Xbox One does use DirectX. Games, in almost all cases, aren&rsquo;t written for the hardware anymore. They are written for the API that talks to the hardware. The hardware could change and as long as the API is aware of that, the games will continue to run. Probably much like they ran on other hardware.As soon as the announcement about console manufacturers opting for a mid-cycle upgrade broke, I saw several media outlets and commenters claiming that this was the end of consoles. Different versions of a console would stratify the market and create confusion among consumers. You would buy a newer game thinking that it would work in your older system and the whole house of cards would be swept away in a gust of specs and frequencies. Making these consoles into upgradable PCs will ruin the industry. The computer I&rsquo;m typing this on is roughly 6 years old, but with a 2 year old video card. The PC sitting 6 feet away from me is almost ten years old. You can play the same games on both. One does a bit better on some games, but neither is any slouch. I have played very new games on the 6 year old PC, and aside from the loss of some visual gloss, they play fine. One uses Nvidia and Intel, the other AMD, but they games don&rsquo;t seem to care much. There is a PC in the basement older than both of them put together, and I managed to spin up linux and a fairly playable copy of minecraft on the thing a while ago. The hardware doesn&rsquo;t really matter any more. Game developers will continue to develop for the average. The computer or console that the most people own will be the development target. A newer Playstation with better chips will offer some headroom, but until the majority of people own that version no game will be made for specifically for that new hardware spec. More importantly, Sony can buy whatever the best price to performance chips are, at commodity prices, and not have to keep a factory busy producing older chips to support a single product. They can keep making the PS4 for 15 years, and it won&rsquo;t really matter what chips are in it, because your games will probably run. This isn&rsquo;t like the N64. If it ever gets to a point where new games don&rsquo;t look as good as you like, or they are getting too slow to be fun, Sony will be more than happy to sell you the newest version for the same $400. So yeah, consoles have become like PCs, and it&rsquo;s about damn time. &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tTwo of the batch of VR headsets that are coming out have made their Debut. If you haven&rsquo;t read any of my other thoughts on VR, I&rsquo;ll fill you in. Good consumer virtual reality, with interesting content can&rsquo;t come fast enough for me. I have wanted to play games in VR since I had any idea what it was, or could be. So a couple of the headsets are out, and what&rsquo;s the verdict?To start off, they are too expensive by at least half. I understand that there is a lot of R&amp;D money sunk into these things, and right now, they are the very definition of an early adopter product. The initial price, both in monies and technical hassle, is going to be very high. The wires alone provide a physical challenge to using the headsets comfortably. The other technical requirements, computer processing power and physical space, are laughably absurd for a consumer product. They are also first launch products, so the content for them is meager. There are a few games that I would love to try out, but most of the experiences seem like novelties. Some of the games seem like something that might have come out for kinect or wii. Those names don&rsquo;t really carry a pedigree of technical excellence, or more importantly, fun. I have only tried one of the headsets on offer, and only a few brief times. The technology works. The feelings it provokes are occasionally stunning, but in the same way that a good amusement park ride is stunning. Powerful, exciting, and best enjoyed in brief bursts. That&rsquo;s not the sort of experience that video games have traditionally been associated with. Thrill rides, yes, but the sort of thrill ride that sustains for 12 hours over many play sessions. So is that it? Is the product too much before its time? Will VR become the fad of 2016 - 2017? Will Oculus and Vive units occupy closet shelves alongside plastic musical instruments and motion controllers? Maybe, but probably not.The first version of the Ipad was not a good product. The screen was awful, the performance was mediocre, and very little of the content took advantage of what was there. The experience of using an Ipad in 2010 simply did not justify the price, size, weight, or hassle. It was a bad product in every measurable dimension, and people loved it. Current Ipads are fantastic machines, and the problem facing apple now is convincing customers to buy a new one when the one they have does what they want it to do so damned well.The promise was apparent in that first Ipad. It wasn&rsquo;t what people wanted it to be, but it was very easy to imagine the version a year or two down the road that worked like you expected. Like you imagined it would. Like you wanted it to. This is where we are with VR. People are buying the promise. By the look of the sales numbers, they are buying the promise in enough volume that a second or third version of this hardware is inevitable. A version that is lighter, with higher resolutions. A version that has no wires tethering it to a computer. A version that presents the content that justifies its existence. I probably won&rsquo;t be buying one of the current headsets, but I am excited about the promise they represent. I&rsquo;ve tried it out. It works. It needs just a little more time before VR hits that Ipad moment. &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tHow long do you think you&rsquo;re going to live? Seriously. Think about it. Me, I plan on living a damn long time, but barring the as yet unreleased Google immortality initiative, I know that I won&rsquo;t live forever. I hope that you will, really I do, but the odds are against all of us. Knowing that, what will you do with the time that you have. For as long as I can remember I have wanted to make video games. I have done peripheral work on a few, but I have never worked on a game, start to finish, and released it to the world. For the past couple of weeks I have been digitally modelling parts to be 3D printed and turned into real physical products. It&rsquo;s neat, but it has very little to do with game development. Now, This could be framed as lost time. This was time that I wasn&rsquo;t working toward my goal of releasing a game. Time I wasn&rsquo;t honing my craft. Time that wasn&rsquo;t part of those 10000 hours required for mastery. Time wasted. I have worked in the fields of graphic design, advertising, manufacturing, drafting, and mapping. Not one of them is game design. I enjoy wood work and metal fabrication. Cutting, joining, welding, and shaping physical material. I also enjoy digital modelling, creating mathematical representations of objects composed of triangles and splines. I like to draw and paint and edit video. I finished the basement of our house, with help, but largely on my own. I will write one day and solder wires another. I am not especially good at any of these things. In no way has any of it been notably successful financially. None of this dabbling has, or likely will, make me tremendously wealthy.Many years ago someone told me that if I wanted to be able to draw as well as my comic illustrator heroes, I would have to focus on only drawing, and forego any other distractions. I would have to sacrifice the small project that interested me in the moment for greater gains down the road. Maybe that was right. Maybe, had I practiced figure drawing rather than leafing through that set of Turbo Pascal manuals, I would have had a different career trajectory. Maybe. Maybe not.How long do you think you&rsquo;re going to live? To focus so thoroughly on one craft, one trade, one endeavor, you must either think that your life will be incredibly short, or incredibly long. You are so harried that to step off the path even a little could lead to ruin, or you assume that there will come some time when all of your work is complete. You can sample all of your other interests then. I don&rsquo;t know how long I will live, and so I think I will sample all of these interests now, on the chance that I will live long enough for them all to weave back together in whatever I am working on in the future. It&rsquo;s the only thing that really makes sense. &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Deus ExThe first time I tried to play Deus Ex, I played it like a shooter. Running from place to place, trying to clear out all the enemies. I thought it was bland, clunky, overly difficult, and directionless. I put it down.That first experience itched at me. Either there was something wrong with the game, or something was wrong with the way that I was playing it. I had to try it again. This time I took it slow. I was familiar with Thief, and that games first person stealth puzzle style. In Thief, avoiding combat is often the easiest way through a level. Pay close enough attention to the patterns of the guards or use your tools effectively and you can circumvent them entirely. I tried to play Deus Ex the same way, but everything felt so loose and sloppy. I couldn&rsquo;t figure out the best pattern to avoid detection. Attempting to navigate the first few areas perfectly resulted in constant trial and error, saving and reloading. I was convinced that I did not like this game, and I put it back down. It might have been a few months later and I started thinking about Deus Ex again. The reviews were out there, and people seemed to love this game. There had to be more too it. I reinstalled the game and everything clicked. I came at it this time thinking that maybe it played more like a japanese RPG, where the story mattered more than the action, and I would have to spend the first few hours flailing around before the meat of the game really started. I was wrong, but this was my entry point. Deus Ex wasn&rsquo;t a shooter, it wasn&rsquo;t a stealth puzzle, it wasn&rsquo;t even a story based RPG. Deus Ex was something completely different. It was fast and improvisational. You could attack any situation in a number of ways, and change your mind mid stream with no better or worse chance of success. It was also steadily paced and methodical. You could use stealth and long range tactics. You could set traps and plan multi part assaults. If it all went south, you could run and hide or lob some grenades and start laying down heavy fire. No single solution was given priority. There was no right way to play Deus Ex. Gradually, as the game wore on, I started to find ways that I prefered to play and tailored my character to suit that style. It happened slowly and organically. I never selected a sniper or heavy weapons class from a menu. The game didn&rsquo;t really seem to have an opinion one way or another. Whatever way I chose to play was good with Deus Ex.Areas that at first glance appeared to be slightly larger, but otherwise familiar first person shooter levels, were actually much more intricate. If you could see a spot on the map, you could probably get there, but you might have to mess with the games systems to do it. Using the environment to achieve your aims became as enjoyable as straight ahead combat. The world was dynamic in a way that invited you to poke and prod at it. Is Deus Ex a perfect game? Oh hell no. It is glitchy and unbalanced in all sorts of strange ways. It feels like a thing barely held together at the seams. One sharp tug and the whole game unravels completely. But what it does do is simulate a world. It is a world that is limited. The boundaries are visible, but still it is simulated not prescribed. If you want to influence the outcome of a given situation, you probably can. You can almost certainly do it in a way that the game designers didn&rsquo;t think of or didn&rsquo;t intend. All of the intermeshed mechanics of the Deus Ex world had been spun up and the designers had let go of the wheel. What the player did with them from that point was up to them. Deus Ex was a unique and fresh take on game design. The games story was linear, to be sure, but nothing else about the game felt like you were playing against the designers. They had come up with a sequence of events, and gave you a whole box full of tools to deal with those events. The important part of this, the thing that makes Deus Ex work, is that the game makes no judgements about what you do with those tools. There is no good or bad way to play. There is no good or evil path through the story. It simply is what you make it. &nbsp;It is how you play it.&#8203;\t\t"

The screens are accustomed to passively watching respond to your intent. This is why I want to make games. This is why I have always wanted to make games. I would sit on the floor looking up at the black and white tv. I thought that if I could only adjust the dials in the right way, I could change the images on the screen. I could influence the flow of light. It would be years before home video game systems were common. I considered, for a short while, creating a mechanical system to remotely control a character or race car or spaceship. I didn&rsquo;t know enough about electronics to create the analogue circuitry used in the earliest video games. I still don&rsquo;t. Making the mechanical system I was dreaming about would probably have been even more difficult. Now I have tools and libraries that make controlling objects on a screen almost trivial. Making it easier to accomplish has done nothing to dull the magic of that feeling. The feeling of moving your thumb and watching blobs of light respond. It still makes me want to make games. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI&rsquo;ve been creating a game. As you would expect, that has made me think about poetry. Obviously. One of my favorite poems is I Have Not Lingered in European Monasteries by Leonard Cohen. It&rsquo;s not my favorite poem. My favorite poem is The &nbsp;Cremation of Sam McGee, but that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m writing about right now. I think that the first time I read I Have Not Lingered in European Monasteries I was either in high school, or maybe I was in the first year of university. Whenever it was, the poem stuck with me. It did what the best poems do. It wrapped up complex and often conflicting feelings, and delivered them in a few well chosen words ready to be unpacked. I found myself thinking about that poem a few days ago, as I often do when I am feeling particularly down on myself. I Have Not Lingered in European Monasteries is, for my money, the best description of imposter syndrome ever written. Every facet of the complex emotional state of knowing yourself to be both competent and hopelessly in over your head, recognising your accomplishments while still waiting to be exposed as a rube. It&rsquo;s the feeling that you haven&rsquo;t earned what you&rsquo;ve done in the right and proper ways, but you are still doing it. All the while the poem is an indictment of the very notion that there is a right and proper way. It also laments the loss of a right and proper way and a life lived superficially. Poems man, just packed right full of stuff. Anyway, I really wrote this so that any time I, or anyone else searches for imposter syndrome, they have a slight chance of also finding, what I think is one of Leonard Cohen&rsquo;s best poems. If you go searching for the reason why, the more you accomplish the more you feel like a fraud, you might find I Have Not Lingered in European Monasteries. Seems a fair trade.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI am roughly 45% composed of nostalgia at this point. I fully expect to continue on this trajectory and transmute into pure nostalgia sometime in my 90s. For a few decades, I will be little more than grunge music, action movie, and video game references. I&rsquo;m looking forward to it, but I preemptively apologize to anyone who has to deal with that.Video games are roughly the same age as me, so video games being really down with nostalgia isn&rsquo;t a big surprise. Retro style games are rampant. 16bit, 8bit, 1bit, analog, rock and stick. If it seems old, we like it. Seems is the most important word in that sentence. New games that adopt a bygone aesthetic can trigger the nostalgia centers. Through nostalgia these games can accumulate an unearned appeal. Nothing nefarious about it. This is the trajectory of every artform that outlasts the generation that created it. So games that seem old can benefit from this effect, but games that are actually old will have to endure based on their own merits. Just as some older films or books are difficult to digest today, some older games are a slog. Some oldies are not as enjoyable when parsed through the modern language of the mediums. We have moved on. This is why I find it endlessly fascinating when someone latches on to the parts of nostalgia that we no longer have the language for. There is a project called the Coleco Chameleon that aims to create a new video game platform with a retro appeal. The project, as it stands, seems to have tanked. There are probably a lot of reasons for that. I won&rsquo;t speculate, but they did post a picture of their prototype hardware that turned out to be a DVR capture card. If there is fraud involved, it&rsquo;s of the profoundly stupid variety. Less interesting to me than the Coleco Chameleon project itself, is the impetus behind it. The pitch for the console is this. It is a machine that would use cartridges, because downloads are terrible and cartridges last for ages. It would not have system updates or patches, because internet connectivity is annoying when what you really want to do is play a game. Games should come to you in a box, self contained, and bug free. This is a message designed to spear its way right into the deep blackness of my aging nostalgic heart. It is one of the most wrong headed pitches I have heard in a long time.Nostalgia only works as a selling point when it is not a rejection of progress. New things that adopt up to date techniques, but remind you of the old things is how nostalgia works. When they look down their nose at contemporary works as somehow less than what came before, they will fail. We have an innate sense that detects grumpy old person disapproval. It smells unpleasant. The real kicker in the case of the Coleco Chameleon is what is being rejected. Video games have come a long way in the past 40 or so years. The biggest shift from the 80s and 90s is the universal recognition that video games are made by people, for people. Being able to meet an author or a director is not an outrageous notion. People expect to see musicians play, live, in front of them. They may have achieved a level of public recognition that few people ever will, but there is absolutely no mistaking it, they are people. They do what people do. They communicate.Up until fairly recently, the only communication between game developers and game players was at the sales counter. Devs made the game, players bought it or didn&rsquo;t buy it, and that was the end. There was no way for the players to say that if just this one thing was tweaked, the game would be so much better. There was no way for the developers to let the players know that they were listening, and that they were working on that change, and not only that, they were excited to do it. All of these things that the makers of the Coleco Chameleon are framing as annoyances, networks, patches, updated, dlc, those are all communication. They aren&rsquo;t perfect, and yes all communication can be frustrating at times, but compare that to the alternative. Video games have long been ridiculed as an insular and isolating medium. Now when communication is becoming the new normal, attempting to champion disconnection and isolation isn&rsquo;t nostalgic. It&rsquo;s just old and we don&rsquo;t speak that language anymore.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Waku Waku 7Waku Waku 7 walks a fine line. Everything about the game is a send up of the fighting genre. Still it manages to be a competent fighter. The characters are thoroughly ridiculous, but not more so than the rosters they are making fun of. The settings and story are knowingly composed entirely of anime tropes.This game would be easy to dismiss if it weren&rsquo;t so surefooted in making fun of itself and all of it&rsquo;s genre baggage.Where a game like DarkStalkers can play off it&rsquo;s silly nature with a classic monster theme, Waku Waku 7 pulls from all the embarrassing nonsense in both anime and fighting games. Let&rsquo;s just run down the character list and you&rsquo;ll see what I mean.You have your plucky high school fist fighter.The anime girl who points her butt at the screen as her winning pose who might also be an anthropomorphised rabbit.The child robot nurse.The Hayao Miyazaki styled walking robot tank.The brooding swordfighter elf guy.A kid riding a purple Totoro.The rugged adventurer. Really it&rsquo;s just Guile with a beard and a hat.The cast rounds out with a Mario chainchomp and a sour faced punching bag.It&rsquo;s like they pulled the character traits out of a hat and mushed them together. This is what you would make if you wanted to simultaneously poke fun at a genre, while never letting on that you are poking fun. It is what it what it is a parody of. Subtlety is not usually the calling card of anime or fighting games, so it really refreshing when it works.So is it better tuned than say, Street Fighter Alpha, or does it feel more precise than King of Fighters. No. Waku Waku 7 never attempts to ascend to those heights. What is though is both very good and very clever. I have one more very to add. Waku Waku 7 is very fun, and that earns it a spot as one of the best games. &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI don&rsquo;t know how you were first introduced to Shakespeare, but it was probably taught to to you in school, and it was probably taught to you wrong. The collected works of William Shakespeare is a pillar of english literature. That much is obvious. Literally hundreds of common words can be traced back to Shakespeare. These are things that we learn in high school. Just being taught Shakespeare can improve you, the english speaker, in some foundational way. Reading Shakespeare is a multivitamin for your teenage mind. Reading Macbeth or Romeo and Juliet will give you a love for all the better things in life. You will probably listen to Vivaldi afterward and do some whittling or something. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong here. I really like me some Shakespeare. But I was that kid. The one who was actually, legitimately, and without prompting, interested in reading Shakespeare. You know, a geek. A theatre geek even. I was also way into video games. Looking back, I&rsquo;m surprised I made it out of high school alive. I really couldn&rsquo;t have been a more perfect target.Even back then I knew that we were being taught Shakespeare wrong. Shakespeare wrote plays, not novels. Sitting at a desk and reading through a play, even one backed up by a handy Coles Notes, is the wrong way to teach a play. You can either watch a play performed, or perform it yourself, but reading the script is absolutely, bar none, the most superficial way to experience a play. A script can be interpreted in so many ways. Every actor, every director, can take those raw words and interpret them in a completely unique way. A tragic line can be played for comedy in the mouth of a deft actor. The impact on the audience is profound. The context of watching actual people move around and say these words changes their meaning. Never, not for one microsecond, was the intention of those scripts for them to be read by a quiet person sitting at a desk. Teaching Shakespeare as literature is to reduce its impact. It&rsquo;s teaching it wrong.So I usually write about games here, because, as stated earlier I&rsquo;m a geek. While there are very few people teaching games as cultural artifacts just yet, it&rsquo;s coming. What got me thinking about Shakespeare was the some of the criticism around games, and how we deconstruct games to make criticism easier. We break down the parts, most notably the narrative gets excised from the gameplay, to make it easier to parse. Maybe there is some clinical value in that. taking each part, graphics, sound, action, writing, and dealing with them one at a time. But ultimately reduction is reduction, and the way we view a thing will influence how we go about making a thing. The only problem is that interacting, playing the game, influences how we view the narrative. As actors provide context for the nuances of a script, gameplay provides context for the narrative of a game. Thinking of them as separate in our evaluation of games can lead to people thinking that this is an okay way of doing things. It isn&rsquo;t.Plays have been around for a while. Like a dawn of civilization while. Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays were written over 400 years ago, and we still haven&rsquo;t figured out how to properly teach them. Video games are only a few decades old, and games with narrative are even younger. Maybe we can get a jump on teaching them a better way. It would be a shame if a hundred years out it became acceptable to have a kid read all the dialog for a game at a desk, and never have them actually play it.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tOne of the advantages of writing these posts every week is that I have an instantly searchable record of all the dumb things that I thought over the past few years. Maybe that&rsquo;s a disadvantage. I&rsquo;m not sure really. Well, what&rsquo;s done is done. A quick search through the past archive for &ldquo;Blender&rdquo; returned a dozen articles. The oldest mention was from 2011. That&rsquo;s sort of a while ago. In 2013 I was pondering moving to using Blender as my main 3D modelling tool. In 2014 I was fighting with the interface and some of the more obscure tools. By 2015 I seemed to be rounding the corner, and I no longer had my finger hovering over the &ldquo;buy Maya&rdquo; button. I was still having some trouble fully committing to using Blender, but I wasn&rsquo;t really looking back either. Finally, after all that time, and a lot of models built, animated, and rendered, last month I realized I was thinking in Blender. I wasn&rsquo;t looking for Blender equivalents of tools from other programs. I was looking for keyboard shortcuts to make the tools available faster and more convenient. I have added a few shortcuts of my own to personalize Blender to the way I want to work. It only took five years, but I got there. Or maybe I&rsquo;m getting there. It&rsquo;s hard to say. Whatever the case I finally feel comfortable using Blender for all my 3D modelling needs. Last week I tried Clara.io and had a quick look at Onshape. They are web based 3D tools that let you work on models using a web browser. While they might be limited now, it&rsquo;s really only a matter of time before a web based art creation tool becomes a kids first, and maybe only tool. Professional workflows will be based around a tool that never actually resides on the user's computer. For a lot of writers, this is already the case. In five years, I&rsquo;ll be able to do a search for this post and pinpoint the time when I started learning whatever comes next. &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tDouble jumping. Simple really. You contract the muscles in your legs, storing energy. You drive as much force as you can muster down into the ground and while raising your center of mass. You lift off, extending your body into a long smooth crescent. As your ascent slows, you pull your legs back up under you, tucking your knees. At the apex of your jump, you spring out again, releasing every last newton of force. You rise again doubling your previous elevation. Maybe three or four times your standing height. Simple.Of course the double jump is a physical impossibility. With nothing substantial to act against, pushing your legs out mid jump would be futile. Gravity wins. You could, conceivably, attach some sort of propulsion system to your legs that would facilitate a double jump, but nothing like that exists. Even if it did, it would be far too dangerous to attempt. Double jumps are the domain of video games.It&rsquo;s curious that we suspend disbelief for video game characters jumping several times their own height, and then doing it again in mid air. Like portals or bottomless pits, we have no real world analogue to tie it to, yet we accept and understand the mechanics of a double jump with no argument. There are characters who can fly in other media. Superheroes have flown for half a century. Superhero flying is wish fulfilment, but it&rsquo;s also not an alien concept in the physical world. Birds fly all the time. No bird ever did a double jump. We have seen examples of crazy wire work in kung fu movies, but as wild as the effect can get the performers are still bound by gravity. Creating a look that is graceful and fantastical, but still plausible is the goal. Movie kung fu does not double jump.This is the envelope that video games have pushed. Physical absurdity. More to the point, agency over physical absurdity. As soon as you are empowered with directing the feat, double jumping seems perfectly normal. Obvious even. Were you to watch it performed in a movie or tv show, you would find it fake and uncanny. Watching a double jump would distance you from the media you were watching, remind you that this is all just pretend. When you press the button that makes events happen, it feels vital and precise. Tangible.The real trick then, is not just bending the laws of physics, but applying this tangibility to other concepts. What other abstract or difficult notions can be made real for people through interaction. Can complex math be demonstrated easily by allowing you to interact. Can ways of seeing the world, unconventional points of view, even empathy, be imparted to a player just by pressing buttons. There is no basis historically, culturally, or evolutionarily for a human being to gain an intuitive understanding of double jumping in seconds. To me, that says that teaching anything through video games is possible.\t\t"

Over the 48 (or so) hour duration of the Global Game Jam, we succeeded, failed, and learned in roughly equal amounts, and in every order that you could possibly arrange those words. Every year that I take part in this game jam, I always end off wishing we could have accomplished more. The next day I&rsquo;m always amazed we accomplished as much as we did.

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI&rsquo;m not an artist. You might think that someone who spent the better part of the last couple decades making stuff, pictures of stuff, pictures all lined up in a row and played back at 30 per second, and pictures you could convince to move around with a gamepad would be an artist. At the very least they would call themselves an artist. When they ask me what I do, I usually tell people &ldquo;I make things&rdquo;. It just feels more comfortable. More honest. A while back I wrote a bunch of words about the the term &ldquo;art&rdquo;. I described how I thought maybe &ldquo;art&rdquo; was more of a verb than a noun, and that anyone that ever made anything is, by definition, an artist. I&rsquo;m not going back on that. I still believe that art is a thing you do and not a thing you make. Whittling down the specifics of the language, people who make things are probably best described as artists. Unfortunately the title of artist is saddled with a lot of expectations and strictures. Artists are supposed to have some well of inspiration. They are supposed to draw on human universal truths. Artists are supposed to be granted some uncommon talent that most people can only marvel at. That&rsquo;s not me. That has never been me. I solve small problems and make things. Maybe there are people out there that have ideas and capacity to manifest those ideas gifted to them. It&rsquo;s nothing that I have any knowledge of. I see a task, break it down into small problems, and solve them one at a time. Sometimes the task is completed, sometimes it isn&rsquo;t, but mostly I just run out of problems I am capable of solving. What comes out the end of that process, I suppose, could be called art. The cultural shorthand for what I do would probably be artist. Maybe the term Maker will fully insert itself into the vernacular, and I can call myself a maker without all the techno-hippy baggage that comes with it. Until then I will continue to do what I have been doing, being fully uncomfortable with the worlds of artists, or makers, or developers. If you read this, the next time you hear me say that I make things, now you will know what I mean. &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Sid Meier&rsquo;s Pirates!Imagine there was a game made up almost entirely of minigames. Strike one. The minigames are repeated a bewildering number of times. Strike two. The bulk of the remaining part of the game is uneventfully sailing across open ocean. Strike three. For a game called Pirates! you very rarely get to wear a captain's hat or an eyepatch. Strike four. That&rsquo;s right. Four Strikes. That&rsquo;s more than the recommended number of strikes. On paper Pirates! should be a dismal failure of a game. It is both repetitive and slow. It&rsquo;s also fun in every direction. The repetitive minigames are fun, or at least short enough that they never become grating. The sailing is simple, but engaging enough that it still demands your attention. The naval combat is so enjoyable that you could probably base a game on ship to ship fighting alone and it would still be fun. The presentation, at least in the 2004 remake, is light and stylish in a way that makes it almost timeless. Save for the resolution of some of the textures, Pirates! could have been released last week. The game is dense with numbers, sliders, and management. This could easily make doing anything a slog. That would be another strike, except Pirates! is so cleanly designed that maintaining a crew of hundreds on a whole fleet of ships is trivial. Even enjoyable. If you had a list of features in front of you, Pirates! appears to be a terrible game. Dull, tedious, and repetitive. The final game is, of course, anything but. The best description would probably be fun. Top to bottom fun. &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI played Bill Budge&rsquo;s Pinball Construction Set some time in the mid 80&rsquo;s. I don&rsquo;t remember exactly when, but I do know that it was on a friends computer, and I do know that it wasn&rsquo;t a legit version. It was a disc with the name Budge PBCS written on it in sharpie and the manual was photocopied. I later wound up buying a real copy of it for the Atari 800 computer out of a bargain bin. I think it cost $2.99. I also bought The Last V8, but that is a disappointment for another time. The thought of being able to create my own pinball tables was intoxicating. I had so many ideas, and I sketched many mockup pinball tables in lined paper notebooks. I wish that I could say that I created a great table. I wish that I could say that I figured out how to link the various bumpers, spinners, and score lights into something playable. I pieced together a few terrible tables, but nothing that anyone would mistake for fun. Shortly after that I put the disk back in it&rsquo;s box and never opened it again.It wasn&rsquo;t that creating pinball tables with Pinball Construction Set was difficult. In fact the tools were incredibly easy to use and surprisingly powerful for the time they were made. The tools included, along with all the requisite pinball gizmos, a vector graphics and raster graphics editor. A lot of modern graphics programs can&rsquo;t muster that kind of oomph. It was shockingly easy to put together something that would play a simple game of pinball. There just wasn&rsquo;t any good reason to do it.This has been the failing of most in game editors, or game construction sets, since developers started making them. There can be an inherent joy in building things. Usually that joy is hinged around the fact that the thing you build will be enjoyed, either by yourself or, and this is the kicker, someone else. Building a thing to be experienced by other people is one of the most fun and satisfying tasks a person can undertake. If you get to witness them enjoying that thing, so much the better. In the mid 1980&rsquo;s finding a way to get a virtual pinball table that would only work on one type of computer into the hands of even a few people so that they could enjoy it was positively herculean. There was very little joy to be squeezed from that activity. It&rsquo;s not very surprising really that I was not incentivized to work very hard at it. We have been playing a decent amount of Super Mario Maker around here. All of the ways that Super Mario Maker is amazing and beautiful and joyful made me wonder why the Little Big Planets and Modnation Racers of the world stumbled. Why did games with intelligent and elegant toolsets for creating game levels and other content not stick.Simply, in Super Mario Maker creation is the game. The levels you play will be created by other people, and you have at least a reasonable expectation that the levels that you create will be played, and enjoyed, by other people. You don&rsquo;t make a level to enjoy playing it yourself, you make it so that other people can enjoy playing it, and you are informed by the game when they do. You may never meet the people who play your levels, you may never get to see the excitement in their eyes when they play your levels, but the system they have created provides enough feedback to spur you on. The loop is complete. You create something, other people enjoy it, you are provided feedback on how they enjoyed it, and that feeds your desire to create more, and better, levels. This is the exact reason that people make games in the first place. They are made for other people to enjoy.Creation might be inherently enjoyable, but let&rsquo;s be honest here, it doesn&rsquo;t get really fun until you can share it with other people.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tIt&rsquo;s 2016. That&rsquo;s one whole digit higher than the last time I wrote one of these. The responsibility to do it up right is tremendous. Not really. I figured I would just ramble on about games for a few hundred words like I usually do, only this time I will be writing about the future. Strap on your shiniest scifi outfit, fire up some theremin music, and cuddle up with your robot companion. Here we go. It&rsquo;s exciting that this year will be the first year of virtual reality. Like actual virtual reality products that you can buy. Lots of them. It is sort of a bummer that virtual reality is the term that we have settled on though. Virtual reality was ginned up in the 80&rsquo;s, before anyone had any idea what we could use these immersive displays for. Recreating reality, the place we all live all of the time, was the best we could come up with. So reality, only not so much.Sometime this year you will be able to buy a high end screen that you can plunk on your head and, I&rsquo;m speculating here, you will be able to pretend you are a giant frog, flying a spaceship, into a star, that turns out be the dream of a young girl from Croatia. Then you get to be the girl, and dream that you are the frog. The girl falls in love with the frog. The frog falls in love with a nebula. It&rsquo;s all very touching and beautiful. The score is by Austin Wintory. It will be decried as heralding the downfall of the games industry. You&rsquo;re going to love it. This year indie games will continue to grow in popularity and cultural relevance, but the term &ldquo;indie&rsquo; will fall out of favour. Indie will be labeled exclusionary and derogatory. Mostly by seattle rock bands that want to take the title back. Also, Electronic Arts will spin up its &ldquo;indie&rdquo; label and start a marketing campaign to attract developers with the tagline &ldquo;hey Indies&rdquo; set to the tune of &ldquo;Mickey&rdquo;. The campaign will end in a dramatic failure, but it will spawn a neogaf thread on whether the original song was titled Mickey, Hey Mickey, Hey Kitty, or simply Kitty. Seven people will become very angry.The latest graphical treatment trend will be visible polygon seams. Several tutorials will go up on Gamasutra defining different ways to create shaders achieving the perfect polygon seam look. Extra aliasing will be computationally costly, but considered worth it. Ubisoft will completely reinvigorate the Assassin's Creed franchise when they release Assassin Creator. The game will allow you to create any assassin and assassination scenario that you can image. The ability to create female assassins will be patched in after launch. Highly anticipated game The Last Guardian will be released. The game will be exactly 83 hours long, regardless of the players actions. To play the game you will mostly have to hold the controller to the right, but occasionally up and to the left. It will go on to be one of the most massive critical successes of the year. One pioneering team will blow it&rsquo;s early access program wide open, and allow players to write code and create art for the game in progress. The game will become an unprecedented money maker. It will be officially released in 2019. Sometime in the early hours of a dark 2016 night, I will put out a game. Of the games I have personally made, it will go on to become an unprecedented money maker. It will be officially released in 2019.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWe went out and saw Star Wars. Don&rsquo;t worry, if you are, statistically, one of the 6 people on the planet who hasn't seen the new Star Wars movie, I won&rsquo;t be spoiling any plot details. After rolling it around my head for a few days, I do have one observation. The prequel Star Wars films are almost universally hated, unfairly so in my opinion. They aren&rsquo;t great movies, and they have problems, but they are entertaining. Entertaining is several rungs up the ladder from interesting. Interesting is about as good as most works of art ever achieve. A movie that is entertaining occupies pretty rarified air. I have the art books from the prequel trilogy, and I have devoured them many many times. The volume and quality of artistic design, the consideration put into every detail of every set and every character, is humbling. It&rsquo;s beautiful in a way that few works of art can hope to be. Not just visually pleasing, but thoughtful. The world created by the Star Wars prequel trilogy is perhaps only rivaled by The Lord of the Rings.There was something missing from the prequels that exists in the original trilogy. I think it is what makes those original movies so much more satisfying. Mystery. I&rsquo;m not talking about the whodunit style of mystery. I&rsquo;m talking about movements in darkened corners and monsters under the bed mystery. Words acted but unspoken and motives unexplained mystery.Lord of the Rings is practically woven of the stuff. Even given the dense tomes written about every aspect of middle earth, there remain plenty of shadowy unexplored corners of that world. If you are like me, and you love Star Wars, you will be happy to know that mystery has been brought back to that world. The prequel movies were a gorgeous world and mythic story explained. This new movie is a story told. There is a difference between action, and adventure. If you were to wander into any one of the dark corners of this story, it&rsquo;s hard to say what danger you might find yourself in. That is mystery, that is adventure, and it is much more satisfying for an audience that they wonder about the dark corners unexplored.There will be talk about the acting, the pacing, the dialogue, the plot all being superior to the previous three Star Wars films. These things are almost unimportant. The real difference, the real single ingredient that makes this movie better than the prequels, is mystery. &#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tspeculation time. About 17 years ago a friend and I talked about a conceptual camera that would capture depth as well as light through a system similar to infrared range finders on automatic cameras. I thought that such a thing would change the way visual effects would be created. As it turned out, it made a clunky input device for your xbox 360 so that you could wave your hands at a video game and have it completely fail to react to your movements. A variation on this type of system is, and has been for some time, used in motion and performance capture studios. The systems are massively expensive and not something that will come to the layman's market any time soon. In 2013 I said on twitter &ldquo;I think the primary thing slowing the advancement of the camera, is the lens. Feel free to use that as a metaphor.&rdquo; At the time I had been thinking about a type of light sensor that would resemble a ball on a stick. It would capture light from all directions and framing, focus, even subtle positioning, would all be post processes. Before anyone starts to imagine that I think I am particularly clever, countless motion capture systems, the microsoft kinect, and the Lytro immerge camera all came out as real physical products. I only ruminate over the concepts that these people make real. If I were actually clever, I would probably have built one or two of these things.Well here is the latest speculation. At some point in the not too distant future, maybe within the next 5 to 10 years, a &ldquo;movie&rdquo; will come out that is entirely rendered on the fly. The data for this dramatic presentation won&rsquo;t be stored in a series of images, it will be 3 dimensional models and captured texture data. It will be fed into a rendering system, not unlike a game engine, and no specific camera angles will be selected by a director. A collection of both new and old techniques will be required to present the story in a way that an audience can follow. The old techniques will come from theatre, specifically theatre presented in the round, where actor movement and blocking are vital to telling a story. The new techniques are currently best understood by game creators. Specifically first person game creators. Drawing an audience to watch what you feel is dramatically important, when they can go anywhere and look at anything will be the cinematography of these new experiences.I don&rsquo;t think these experiences will supplant movies and theatre, but they will exist alongside them. Considering the best ways to use such a medium will be important. Maybe this is the one time I might be qualified to take advantage of one of my speculations.&#8203;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\t This is my 3D printer. There are many like it, but this one is mine. I built this unit from a kit. You can buy kits like this online pretty cheaply now, but I think you should know what you are in for here. If you buy one of these units, the first thing you will have to do is assemble it. It&rsquo;s not very difficult to do, but the instructions aren&rsquo;t great and it can get a bit fiddly in spots. Still with me? I can imagine not wanting to build a 3D printer, but getting one running well is way more involved. In that respect, building from a kit or buying a machine that is pre-built would be no different. Figuring out how it works best and accounting for all the machines unique quirks and variables takes time, patience, and a certain amount of scientific rigor. Diagnosing problems and then finding solutions for them just so happens to make my particular brain very happy. I can understand that this might not be the case for everyone.Here is a quick example of what I have been dealing with.My 3D printer has an issue with usb communication. I can see everything that the machine is doing echoed back on my computer, but I can&rsquo;t send any commands to the board. Running programs off of the sd card still works properly, so if I want to send one small Gcode command or do something simple, like find out what the steps per millimeter is on the Y axis, I have to write a program, unmount the sd card from the machine, remove the sd card, put the sd card in a full size adapter, stick the adapter into my computer, copy the program over, remove the card, put it back into the printer, mount the card so that the printer can see it, and then run the program. The printer will echo back any info to the pc so I can read it. If I want to change the setting, I need to write a program to do that and repeat the whole process. It&rsquo;s tedious, but it works.After trying just about everything, I think that this droid has a bad motivator. The mainboard is a little bit broken. Or a little bit bad. Maybe it was always bad. I&rsquo;ve tested it on a windows and a linux computer with similar results. It&rsquo;s pretty safe to say that the problem is with the hardware.A more general problem that would be encountered in any 3D printer, even the several thousand dollar &ldquo;user friendly&rdquo; versions, is adjusting the optimal print settings. I spent several years operating CNC router machines. Giant, heavy, room filling jobbers that run tolerances of a few thousandths of an inch over 8 feet. By comparison, this 3D printer is spongy. If you are within half a millimeter that&rsquo;s about the best you can hope for. To a machinist this would be considered sloppy. Like pushing around a pool of molten mush, not manufacturing. I may have a slightly different mindset to some of the people that write about precision tuning these printers. Getting the machine to run &lsquo;good enough&rsquo; is actually fairly easy. That said, there are a lot of tests you need to do to get the temperature, movement speed, and build strategy zeroed in. If you want the machine to print consistently you need to control the entire operation. This is something I&rsquo;m still working on, but the prints are getting better. So there you go. If you don&rsquo;t like troubleshooting, don&rsquo;t buy a 3D printer, even one of the very expensive ones.           This is the bin of failed prints and support plastic. I expect to fill this thing before I get a perfect print.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\t       Best Games - Penguin Kun WarsTwo tiny, adorable animals face each other grimly across an empty ping pong table. On both sides sit a lineup of brightly coloured balls. These are your weapons. When the whistle blows, the opponents will make a frenzied dash to whip the balls at other side of the table. All balls are in play. If a ball ends up on your side, you can pick it up and send it hurtling back. If one of the animals is struck with a ball, any ball, they will be dazed for a few seconds. If a dazed animal is hit again, the knockdown is extended. When the round timer runs out, and the final buzzer sounds, the player who has managed to end up with the fewest balls on their side, wins. Occasionally an iridescent slinky undulates across the table. That slinky is a dick.In concept this is the simplest game in the world. If you have ever rolled pool balls back and forth across a pool table, you have played a version of Penguin Kun Wars. Since the fictional world of a video game obeys a strict set of rules, none of the looseness and unpredictable behavior of real physical objects exists. This is dodgeball or marbles or shuffleboard stripped to the very core. The game is iron hard. Compared to its contemporaries, games from Nintendo, Capcom, and Konami, UPL created a spartan and dull looking game. There is very little in the way of graphical flourishes present in Penguin Kun Wars. The audio is basic and sounds largely lifted from other titles. It looks and sounds like a game several years older than it is, from a less technically capable time. Damning stuff, if the game didn&rsquo;t play as tightly, as singularly focused as it does. There are small interstitial mini games and additional wrinkles as you move from match to match in the tournament structure, but none of that really matters. All that matters is that you get those balls to the other side of the table. Roughly two rounds in, the tactic that seemed cheap and unsportsmanlike of continually pelting that poor animal across from you so they never get the chance to stand back up, becomes a basic survival skill. You would toss a knife at that cute, saucer eyed monster if you had it. Penguin Kun Wars devolves this block coloured world full of stuffed toy creatures into a screaming, clawing death match, never once betraying the games internal violence through its presentation. Play Penguin Kun Wars, and I defy you not to curse through your gritted teeth. Penguin Kun Wars is one of the best games.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI nearly fell into a classic game development blunder. At least I assume that it&rsquo;s a classic, I haven&rsquo;t really made enough games to know the full spectrum of blunders. I figure if I drunkenly stomp my way into a few of them every week or so I&rsquo;ll eventually get to all of the classics. This particular blunder was trying to shoehorn gameplay into a theme. Most games will hang some sort of story, even very loosely, around the mechanics of the game. Chess names the pieces as if they were mock kingdoms at war. Chess needs no story. It could exist entirely in the abstract. The pieces could be ranked by size, or numbered, or have their movement options etched into them. Any of these options could actually serve the game better, by making it more user accessible. Rather than having to teach a new player that the horse is actually a knight, maybe, and its movements are completely different than any other piece on the board. At one point during the evolution of chess from a much older Indian game, Chaturanga, the horse made good sense. Now it is just a weird relic achieved by having a game adhere to a battlefield theme. Of course there are several games that are completely abstract, like Reversi (which had theme applied to it when it was later marketed as Othello), Go (which may or may not have arisen from siege tactics), Backgammon, and Tetris. In the case of videogames, a game without a theme is rare. It might have something to do with how we experience them. Fast action on a screen is the domain of drama. We are accustomed to seeing and hearing stories delivered through screens, so adding story, theme, and characters to videogames might be a natural extension of that familiarity. Whatever the reason, videogames are historically linked to theme, and I made the mistake of prioritizing theme over mechanics. The truth is, games are a do, don&rsquo;t show, medium. Mechanics always trumps theme. Or always should. Even the mechanic of a Choose Your Own Adventure story is more important than the theme, since the story devolves into nonsense as soon as you diverge from the mechanic of making choices and turning to the appropriate page. The theme is interchangeable with other themes, but the mechanic is not. It is the mechanic of choices in a branching narrative that makes a Choose Your Own Adventure book what it is, not the story. I had, or maybe have, a theme based around chemistry, or at least a comedic outlook on chemistry. I had done a fair bit of research into actual, real world chemical reactions, and began applying what I learned to the mechanics of my game. I am certain that a game could be built around atomic interactions as we understand them, but I was finding that it was becoming more and more difficult to make the game fun. Or at the very least, not needlessly complex. I really enjoy the theme I was working with. I even liked some of the jokes I had written based around that theme, but I had lost sight of what makes a game, a game. What is it they always tell you when dealing with creative works? You have to be ready to kill your darlings. If the theme isn&rsquo;t working for the game, then the theme has to go, not the game mechanics. The very moment this sunk through my head, I came up with (and began implementing) several ways to make the game fun. They will have to be tested as abstract game mechanics to see if they work, and they can&rsquo;t rely on theme to prop them up if they don&rsquo;t. Maybe, eventually, I&rsquo;ll be able to draw the original theme back into the game. If so, then great, but if the game mechanics and the theme are at odds, it is the theme that has to be cut loose every single time.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tAll of that talk about interfaces and input schemes last week wasn&rsquo;t for nothing. I was figuring out a few things and, well, this is some of the results.         &#8203;That video is a prototype interface for the game I&rsquo;m making. I had messed around with all sorts of mouse and touch control setups and nothing really felt right. It needed to be simple, yet analog enough to give the player a feeling of control. Previously I had a button with a sort of timer on it. The longer the player pressed the button, mouse button, space bar, or x button, the more force would be behind the launch of one of those little marbles. That worked but it felt like landing an intended shot was based more on luck than any learned skill. I had a crude mouse aim setup going for a while, but that didn&rsquo;t work very well and felt weird. When I finally arrived at the slider mechanic for launching the marbles it felt natural, offered great player feedback, and works well with mouse, touch, and controller input. Pull down on the slider to apply the desired amount of force, wait until the right moment to let go, and then let go to launch. It&rsquo;s incredibly simple, but it took a fair bit of work to get it all working consistently well.The game itself is a riff on games like puzzle bobble where the aim is to fire object accurately at a field of similar objects to make things happen. As you can see in the video, one of the things that can happen is a violent explosion. I have the bubbles set to explode when certain criteria are reached. In the case of this test it&rsquo;s the countdown of a random timer, but really it could be almost anything. Exploding won&rsquo;t be the only thing that could happen, it probably won&rsquo;t even be one of the most common things that could happen, but it&rsquo;s sort of fun and makes for a good test of the game physics.Everything in this video is way deep in the prototype phase. I even had some crummy art in place in an earlier test version, but I took it out so that I had to focus only on the gameplay. I have the presentation elements of the game completely separated from the code. I could have it launching bananas and Buicks by tomorrow afternoon, and the game wouldn&rsquo;t know the difference. I do have a plan for what the presentation will be,but it won&rsquo;t be food or car related. I&rsquo;ll get to writing about that later. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI&rsquo;m looking at this xbox360 gamepad sitting on my desk. There are 6 buttons, two bumpers (which are also buttons), two triggers (squishy analog buttons), two analog thumbsticks (which are buttons if you press down on them), a digital directional pad (4 buttons linked under a single piece of plastic), and a power indicator led (you guessed it, a button). When I pick the thing up I have a minimum of two fingers on each hand not directly hovering over an input. The playstation and wiiu pads are much the same. This standardization is both a boon and a constraint for developers. While you have at least a baseline expectation of the controls your players will be familiar with, you are also restricted to those inputs. To be fair, that is an awful lot of potential inputs, and if you can&rsquo;t find a way to fit your game into the controls offered in modern gamepads, it might not be the pads that are at fault. There is also another input system that, inarguably, more people, potential players, are intimately familiar with. Touch screens are so interwoven into most people's lives at this point that pressing your finger to a piece of glass is a many times a day event. Touch screens are interesting, since they offer only one type of physical input, pressing your finger to a piece of glass, but they can be tuned and adjusted to offer an almost limitless number of interactions. Gamepads, touchscreens, keyboards, mice, and motion detecting devices are all input methods for whatever software you have running. They aren&rsquo;t controls though. Game controls are how the player tells the game what they want to do. Controls have to work within the constraints of the input methods, but they are two separate things and require a different mindset. I laid out how many buttons are on a standard gamepad earlier, but that variety is meant to accommodate any game a developer can come up with. Designing controls is more like creating a conversation.I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of thinking about controls schemes lately. For one, I have been working on the controls for my own game, so that gets the old gears a turning. Also I have been playing a lot of older games recently. It&rsquo;s really at looking at older video games that you can start to tear down control schemes. If you only look at more recent games, the controls are either so well established that they have become dogma, or they are so novel that we are not yet aware of how they could be improved. Modern first person shooters, for example, often include bindings reminiscent of other games in the genre since they are basically riffs on the same tune. They actually use the same controls as their competitors as a selling point. Moving from Call of Duty to Halo? No problem, there is a setup for that, just hit the same buttons and make explosions happen. This works well for that style of game, but what happens when we adopt that same fps control scheme to a game like Everyone's Gone to the Rapture. That game was roundly criticized for being too slow, too sparse, and maybe it just wasn&rsquo;t a good fit for a control scheme built around high speed competitive games. Just because the controls are comfortable to a lot of players doesn&rsquo;t mean that it is an appropriate conversation vehicle between them and your game.Likewise, adopting a dual stick control system on touch screen devices is rarely optimal. Anytime gameplay can be obscured by the player's thumb, the conversation between them and the game breaks down.I struggled with creating suitable controls for my own game. I attempted to incorporate properties of mice, gamepads, and touchscreens and everything felt poor. They were all half measure solutions. Then it occurred to me that what I really want is for the player to be able to converse with the game. The player provides input and receives feedback in equal measure. As soon as that clicked for me, I reduced all the control complexity I had been building down to one finger press, one analog stick, or one mouse movement. All now work equally well since I wasn&rsquo;t designing for the controller, I was designing for the player.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tMuch has been made of the walking simulators. Games like Gone Home, Everyone&rsquo;s Gone to the Rapture, or Sunset. These are games where the players primary goal is to exist in a different place for a while, and maybe, as an aside, read, watch, or listen to a story. For such inherently gentle experiences they have proven to be polarizing, often in angry ways. There is an entire factions of people who wring hands about whether these experiences can be allowed to call themselves games. It&rsquo;s an argument that I find so profoundly dumb I don&rsquo;t really feel like addressing it head on. Since I&rsquo;m the one writing, I won&rsquo;t. We demolished the border between what is and is not a game sometime in the mid 90s when the band Primus put Macromedia director content on their &ldquo;interactive&rdquo; CDs. Game is a catch all term for interactive experiences. Sometimes words are hard folks. We don&rsquo;t always use the right ones, and whatever the argument against using the term &ldquo;game&rdquo; is, that ship has sailed far past the horizon by now.So game it is then.I think I might know where the anger comes from though. There is an either/or mentality among some folks that manifests itself as fear. Sure games are a very trivial things, but they are also a lot of peoples main hobby. If they aren&rsquo;t working, sleeping, or otherwise dealing with life they are playing games. The amount of time and energy sunk makes gaming important, regardless of any objective value. Now here is where the either/or mentality kicks in. If a game like Gone Home starts to receive a lot of praise, and it&rsquo;s not the type of game that the person who puts a heavy value on games enjoys, there is a fear that developers will create more games like Gone Home, and less of everything else. Which is false of course. Except it&rsquo;s not. That fear is at least half right. There will be a lot more walking simulators in our near future.The reason is VR. There are at least three actual consumer products coming in the next year or so that a decent number of self identified gamers will be buying. The will buy these headsets with millimeter accurate positional tracking and positional sound systems and they will want to use them to play a game. The VR headsets ability to make you feel like you are existing in a different place weaves together so tightly with the walking simulators aims of telling story through environment, the result is inevitable. There will be a lot of games created where you move slowly and have a story told to you. There will be lots of elements for a player to interact with, to be sure games are still a medium of interaction, but the walking simulators are coming. They are coming, and they will just keep getting better.Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Evil Dead, and On Golden Pond all came out in 1981. These are all very different movies, that seem on the surface to target different audiences. They are all amazing and intensely enjoyable movies. While I could imagine the person that wouldn&rsquo;t seek out each of these movies individually, there is also an audience that watched them all. More importantly, the success of one didn&rsquo;t come at the cost of the other. There is no either/or when it comes to what people enjoy. There is only &lsquo;and&rsquo;.The walking simulators are coming, but maybe, just maybe, what we learn about creating interactive experiences will make all games better.\t\t"

The freedom that the player has to interact with a system of rules, opponents, and environmental obstacles is reduced to a few verbs. Run, jump, throw a ball, roll a die. The contrivance of a game necessarily constrains what we do and when we do it. A players verbs become very important. Look at that bizarre list of nonsense at the top. That wall of text is the collection of verbs presented to the player when you pause the game Aztec for the Apple II. It may not be the cleanest interface, but you have to admit, that&rsquo;s a lot of verbs.My friend had an Apple IIgs when we were kids. The gs stood for graphics and sound. It was a beefed up version of the Apple II computer that was ubiquitous in schools through the mid 80s, a computer not really known for either it&rsquo;s graphics or it&rsquo;s sound. While the Apple IIgs computer was certainly capable of producing a nice looking version of Tass Times in Tonetown or Winter Games, I always had a fascination with Aztec.Of course, Aztec is terrible.Aztec took the graphics and the sound out back and shot them. It was originally written for the vanilla Apple II. I can only assume that when the Apple II was created someone A/B tested the worst colors available with until the entire palette was composed of nothing but visual tragedy. I mean look at this.           \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t          \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t          \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t \t   That is the most god awful collection of pixels ever drawn to a screen. Even given the limited palette and low resolution, that is a sorry looking presentation. I have thought about it for decades, and I still have no clue what that blue mess on the right half of the opening screen is.The sound is little more than mechanical squawks and digital farts. It makes sense that they put an option to turn it off completely in the main controls. Shutting off the audio is truly the most humane thing to do. The controls are a finger contorting travesty. I have played flight sims with a more cleanly laid out interface, and in this game you only have to control a guy. Controlling a guy is something that game developers were actually pretty competent at in 1982. This advancement seems to have sidestepped Aztec. If you did manager to figure out the controls, getting the guy to move in a predictable manner was still close to impossible. Despite the existence of a run command, the guy has one speed, slow. If he collides with anything he will get knocked down and dizzied for a few moments. Fall and he&rsquo;s knocked out. Hit a wall and he&rsquo;s knocked out. Be in the room with an explosive and he&rsquo;s knocked out. Bump into a pixel that the game thinks might be a wall and he&rsquo;s knocked out. The end of game reward should be a CT scan.One of the key innovations of Aztec was the procedural generation system. Each time you played, the game would create an entirely new set of maps for you to navigate, with different pathways, and different enemy and trap positions. Unfortunately the artificial intelligence laying out the maps was for real stupid. The system that created that maps didn&rsquo;t seem to care if it was actually possible to complete the game, it just tossed objects and staircases around inside rectangular rooms until they were all full. Stairs would attach to other stairs with no way to actually climb them. Item boxes would be placed in inaccessible areas. Enemys would spawn inside a wall to remain stuck there for the duration of the game.You might be thinking that this game sounds awful, and it is. Games are about verbs. The verbs available to the players and the verbs that are built into the constructed world of a game. In Aztec, the verbs are more important than the game. If you place an explosive it will dutifully destroy entire sections of the level, even if that means the game is no longer winnable. If you shoot a the pistol, it might pass through the wall or hit some stray pixel cruft before striking your target, but it always does something. The game is glitchy and broken in ways that are impossible to predict, but there is always something happening, and the world is always reacting to your inputs. The game is ready for you to mess with it in all sorts of unintended ways. This was the first computer game that I had played that allowed that freeform approach. The rules of the system are really more like guidelines. It was as fascinating and amazing then as Minecraft and Terraria are today.Aztec is a bad game. It&rsquo;s also one of the best games.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tMy son likes to ask me a lot of science questions. I often have an answer for the first few questions, but as the interrogation intensifies, I usually have to offer up either &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;, &ldquo;we should look that up&rdquo;, or both. He likes mathematically precise answers without a lot of &lsquo;sometimes&rsquo;es and &lsquo;in this case&rsquo;es. That&rsquo;s probably a kid thing.Recently he has been asking a lot of questions about metals and states of matter and the periodic table of elements. It&rsquo;s good then that a lot of those questions can be answered with numbers, or by pointing at a chemical symbol. I try to answer the questions that I can, but we can always check the table or ask google. That usually spawns dozens more questions. It&rsquo;s sort of a quiz show hydra, but I&rsquo;m just glad they wonder about the nature of the world they live in and don&rsquo;t just find it boring. I&rsquo;ve always been confounded by people who say science is boring.The game I am working on has a sciency element to it. It is more fanciful than accurate, which seems the best way to create a fun playable game. I have fake elements, with fake properties, but their interactions border on something that might be called realistic. I&rsquo;m finding it a tough line to walk. On one hand, I would like it if the game was even slightly educational. Swap out my fake elements for some real ones, and maybe someone would learn something about chemistry. On the other, much more important, hand, I would like the game to be fun and not bogged down in trying to be physically accurate. It might never happen, but I am already bracing for the responses. I keep trying to address an invisible critic that would hold me to some degree of scientific accuracy, and I haven&rsquo;t even got my games controls fully implemented. It&rsquo;s probably something that I shouldn&rsquo;t really worry about, but it&rsquo;s a difficult feeling to shake. Maybe I have become so used to trying to answer questions with definitive answers, that I just expect that is what the rest of the world would want too.\t\t"

I&rsquo;m thankful for analog controls, open source software, the return of the indie developer, democratization of high end game engines, capacitive touch screens, societal recognition of the value of play, making and the industrialization of the hippie, renewed interest in science, living in one of the few countries on the planet where you can say that there is almost literally no better place to be, strong black coffee, and the air denial power of the shoryuken.Most of that list is honestly how I feel. I&rsquo;ll let you decide which ones I tossed in for fun. A more serious list would have only one entry. My family, immediate, extended, and chosen. I thank you and I am thankful for you.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWhen I was a kid someone got me the Wonderful Waterful Robot. It was one of those water filled toys with a single button attached to a simple water pump. Press the button, and you squeeze water out of the pump reservoir and into the main chamber like a fully enclosed squirt gun. The movement of the water would float the 4 robot puzzle pieces around inside the chamber. The swirling was so chaotic that the toy appears to be just a random tempest of plastic objects. I loved it.         &#8203;The object was to float the robot parts up and onto a plastic guide in the center of the playfield. To win you had to not only stack the parts in the proper order, but also in the correct orientation. The guide had a graduated width so that only the feet could fit in the foot position of the puzzle. This meant that if you just wanted to stack all the parts on the guide, there was only one possible order. No putting the pants above the head monkey business. Wonderful Waterful Robot was here to challenge you and it has no time for silliness. That became crystal clear when you finally went to put the head on the top. The head piece has no hole for the guide to fit into, and the guide stops just before the neck. If you want to put the head on and finish the puzzle you would need to gently float it up on top without shooting the water out so hard that you push the torso up and off the guide. It was almost cruelly difficult. I was probably 4 years old, and I must have completed that puzzle dozens of times.Here is the thing about the Wonderful Waterful Robot. Anyone who picked it up was compelled to mash that button way past the point of simply getting it. An adult who picks up a child's toy can usually figure out the boundaries of the experience fairly quickly, then they lose interest and put it back down. A child will play with anything, because every experience is novel to a 4 year old. An adult might take a bit more convincing. So why then did this dumb, random, kids robot puzzle keep everyone who attempted it hooked longer than a ball and cup. I think I have the answer to that, and it has something to do with the nature of fun.Okay so you will have to forgive my pedantry for a minute here while I break this down. I both despise and participate wholeheartedly in the traditional nerd pastime of quantifying and categorizing everything. I think that setting up concrete rules for intrinsically fluid concepts is probably harmful, both to the person setting the rules, and to the people they interact with. That said, Pedant Engines Engage!I&rsquo;m going to try to define fun. I think that maybe fun and joy are different things. Joy you experience, but fun you participate in. You can pass through joy, letting it drape over you, but fun is something that you enact on the world.Now I&rsquo;m really in it. Just when you thought I couldn&rsquo;t get more up my own butt, I&rsquo;m going to tell you what I think is going on in your head when you have fun. You can rest assured that I am not a psychologist, and have done little to no scientific research on this. That&rsquo;s how you know this is really grade A choice cut pedantry.Fun is identifying patterns. That&rsquo;s it. Nothing more to it. When we identify a pattern in what previously seemed like random noise, that experience, that feeling, that is what we call fun. The tiny rush you feel when you correctly predict the trajectory of a ball, move your hand to the right place at the right time and catch it mid flight. That might seem like very basic, predetermined mathematics. The ball will always follow this precise arc, over this precise distance, but the real world is lousy with variables. Is the wind blowing? How hard and in what direction? Is the ground even where you will place your foot? Are the aerodynamics of the ball consistent, or have they altered subtly? A few millimeters off in your prediction is the difference between a caught ball and a dropped one. Or maybe a broken nose. If you oscillate between unknowable chaos and recognizable, predictable patterns repeatedly, you have the formula for every sport ever played. Fun is a temporary, percussive sensation, but fun sustained can create joy.Nice theory, but what does that have to do with the Wonderful Waterful Robot? When anyone picked up that simple puzzle toy, they could never stop at pressing the button just once or twice. They would squeeze water through that thing again and again, varying the rhythm and power of each button press until they could get those 4 robot pieces to drift in just the way they wanted. Even releasing the button would cause some controllable turbulence. Soon the player would be able to select the piece they wanted to move and subtly direct its motion with deft control of the toys single button. The player began to predict the effect of forces that they could not see, on objects too diverse in size and shape to easily compute.Wonderful Waterful Robot is as pure an example of the human ability to find patterns in chaos as I have ever seen. It was simple and precise in a way that I doubt the creators had intended. People would pick it up, and spend several minutes fiddling with it, not because it was such a clever puzzle, but because it was fun.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThis week I was doing some physics fiddling. Even early on in a game prototype, when I should be throwing everything at the wall, I tend to hold back. I&rsquo;m always looking for that one thing that I implement that will push the entire flaming mess over the edge and reduce the framerate to Muybridge reference book. Of course, whatever that one thing was, it would be absolutely integral to the game and I would have to rebuild the entire structure from scratch just to work around it.That never actually happens. It turns out that even the tiny computers in phones and tablets are ridiculously powerful, and it would take some truly thoughtless design to stop them from running most game prototypes. At one point I had it so that the game would get stuck in a loop and infinitely spawn physics objects that would collide with other physics objects triggering the spawning of even more physics objects. I left this mess running on my phone for several minutes. Eventually the game was drawing one frame every few seconds, but it never crashed. Most of the screen was filled with barely moving spheres, several hundred thousand pixel shaded polygons all told, each object with it&rsquo;s own calculated physical reaction to the objects around it. I had made little to no attempt to optimise anything in the game, and still it kept on running. I used to test out new video cards by creating an array of duplicate primitive objects, cubes, spheres, or cones, in Maya. Early GeForce cards and Pentium2 processors could deal with a few hundred. The last time I tried that particular benchmark the fan on my Graphics card spun up, but the screen was filled with a 3D grid of objects that looked like a scifi novel cover. Cones as far as you could see in any direction. I haven&rsquo;t tried it, but I suspect that my phone would perform pretty well in such a test. There is a reason why the digital special effects in Jurassic Park and Terminator 2 don&rsquo;t look like &ldquo;bad cg&rdquo;. A lot of people, casual moviegoers and filmmakers alike, tend to say that it is due to the mix of practical, in camera effects, and computer generated effects. The real world puppets, makeup, and motion controlled models cover for the CG, because CG is always bad. This is, of course, completely wrong. These movies were made in the early days of digital effects. No one really knew what would work on film. Could a completely digital T-Rex command the same presence on screen as a real physical object would. Absolutely no one had an answer for that question, so the best course of action was to use the bleeding edge of technology as sparingly as possible. You could always cut around it if it didn&rsquo;t work out.These new visual effects technologies were pushed only far enough to achieve the required effect on screen, and no more. Leaning on the liquid metal effect in Terminator 2 would mean that there would be no way to drop scenes that didn&rsquo;t work. The end goal of the effects in T2 was the visceral feeling of battling an opponent without substance, it was never meant to be a catch all solution for every special effects need. The new film Mad Max Fury Road is applauded for it&rsquo;s use of practical effects over digital ones. Barely a frame of that movie goes by without some digital manipulation. The color in every shot is bent so hard it could have been filmed in black and white and tones painted in after the fact. The effects never draw that much attention to themselves, because they are only used to achieve a certain feeling, they are not the content of the scene.With the staggering amount of processing power available to modern video games, it might seem possible to just turn on pretty shaders and dynamic physics and have that be your game. This is where, maybe some restraint is in order. If an processor intensive task is actually creating the feeling you want your players to be feeling it might be worth pursuing. If it&rsquo;s not, but the technology is letting you get away with extras, it might be better to simply cut that effect and work around it. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI have been using Playmaker a lot recently. Playmaker is finite state machine and visual scripting editor for unity. I like it a ton. A finite state machine is a sort of burly flowchart. Rather than have simple yes/no options at the intersection of the flowchart, you have states that a program can be in. If you were creating a character movement system for a game you could have a state that waits for player input. Input would trigger another state where the character would move based on that input. There can be another state also running that would watch for collisions and transition the character out of movement and into a collision animation when they hit a wall. States can be one shot effects, that terminate on completion or transition back to a previous state, or they can be loops that run continuously until some criteria is met triggering a transition. There are probably as many ways to wire these states up as there are people who look at the problem. While not all programming problems can or should be solved using finite state machines, they are ridiculously powerful tools. They are especially useful for videogames because games by their nature are interactive and reactive computer programs. Input produces output, and everything is based on interlocking systems and rules.Playmaker is also a visual scripting tool. One of the main selling points for visual scripting is that you don&rsquo;t need to know a programming language to use it. Most tasks in a visual editor are drag and drop, click buttons, and fill in input field operations. Of course, not needing to know a programming language is a long ways from not knowing how to program. Playmaker can streamline the process a bit, but you won&rsquo;t get much out of it until you can plan out a logical sequence of events. If you have some experience with any programming language you will have a much easier time navigating Playmaker. C# happens to be the language that Playmaker is written in so that might be a good place to start. Then again, I started with z80 basic, so what do I know.Of course a lot of people come to these visual scripting tools with no programming knowledge at all. Without context it may be more difficult to figure out what&rsquo;s going on in Playmaker, but I think this is where these types of tools really shine. I feel relatively comfortable shifting back and forth between Playmaker and C# scripts in the &ldquo;knows just enough to be dangerous&rdquo; sort of way, but I could imagine someone transitioning smoothly from learning a visual scripting tool to learning plain old, no tool assisted, programming. In fact, I think this will be the preferred way to teach programming to kids until we can come up with something better.For the project I&rsquo;m currently working on, I plan to use Playmaker as much as possible. Occasionally that has meant writing a quick addon script for it in C# just so I could do something that was difficult or cumbersome inside the visual tool. Keeping all my game logic in the state machine framework of Playmaker is also incredibly useful.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - DescentAt one point 3d graphics were so whiz-bang new that a game could be based entirely around the ability to move in all directions. Soak that in for a second. Moving forward, back, left, right, up, down, and rotating around an axis was so novel that a very successful game used that as it&rsquo;s selling point.Descent hangs a very thin story, repetitive mission structure, and combat mechanics as nuanced as a schoolyard snowball fight on the ability to move in any direction without the hassle of pesky things like gravity or realistic inertia. It was amazing, groundbreaking, completely disorienting, and for most people, almost completely unplayable.It&rsquo;s not very surprising then, that after Descent, and a few other attempts at this freedom of movement based gameplay, the industry sort of just gave up on it. Our brains are really good at 2d and limited 3d movement. For most of our lives up is up, down is down, and our heads remain consistently level with the horizon. Even when we ride in vehicles that can operate in fluid environments like air and water, we still know that up is up, and down is down. Removing that restriction takes some getting used to.Descent is more experiment than actual game though. Flight simulators had been around for a good long time before Descent came out, but they all operate on the idea that they are modelling a real physical world that reacts in ways we are accustomed to. Descent is a game of what if. What if gravity was not a factor. What if the horizon is relative to the observer, not a predefined aspect of the physical world. What if your rotation and direction of travel were independent vectors. Of course, all of these what ifs are actual facts of movement in a 3 dimensional universe, but for earthbound mammals like us it can be difficult to shed our preconceptions.Descent would likely be a strange footnote in the history of video games. One success among dozens of failures. I think maybe it just came out too early.In an industry driven by novelty, they ability to navigate your environment in ways that are just not normally possible might be the most novel thing of all. Pair that with a unique way to inhabit that environment, like the Oculus Rift, and you have the rebirth of an entire genre of movement based games. Keeping your lunch down might require a more old school solution. What I&rsquo;m really saying is, maybe now would be a good time to stock up on ginger root.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tSo, up until last week I had a perfect record. 144 weeks since I started doing this posting something every monday, usually a screed hastily smashed out on sunday night, I have never missed a post. A couple of times I posted around 11:30 monday night. Even when we took a trip to DisneyWorld, I managed to type something up on the Nexus 7 tablet and had it posted for monday. Unfortunately, last monday technology failed me. I was heading out of town and wouldn&rsquo;t be back until late on monday so I decided to use the post scheduling feature of my websites content management system. My post consisted entirely of a single picture and a short caption. The post didn&rsquo;t get posted, and the caption was lost to the digital ether. That picture went up on tuesday, and I couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to recover the caption. Technology, I&rsquo;m not mad, just disappointed. On the other hand, the content of that post was the first object ever extruded from my 3d printer. A few weeks ago I wrote about assembling the machine. That was as far as it got. Assembled. I was able to start the thing up and shuttle the print head around a bit, but I couldn&rsquo;t get it to graduate from demo mode to actually printing. After some investigative diagnostics, I managed to figure out that the temperature sensor for the print bed wasn&rsquo;t working. Actually it was smashed practically back to sand. A handy safety feature for the printer is that it won&rsquo;t try to heat anything up if it can&rsquo;t tell what temperature it is. So that&rsquo;s good I suppose. Less good was waiting for the replacement parts to arrive. Thermistors cost somewhere south of 40 cents, but they are apparently required to circumnavigate the globe before they can be delivered to you, so I had to wait weeks before I could find out if this structure I had constructed could actually print at all. A quick solder job later and the new thermistor was installed. The printer started up just fine and accurate temperature readings started squirting out of the print bed. It wasn&rsquo;t until the next day that I managed to get it to print one very small part. I printed a tiny thing that I had modelled in Blender and hastily ran through software that breaks the model down into tiny slices and converts that information into g-code, a common language used to control automated machines. I printed that a few hours before we left on our trip. I took a picture of it and created a post scheduled to go up mid afternoon monday, a time I knew I would be driving. The post never went up, but I would say that, technology wise, I came out ahead.Next week I&rsquo;ll probably be back to writing about games again. On mondays.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tTime magazine ran a cover depicting Oculus founder Palmer Luckey leaping into the air in front of what appears to be a high school grad photo backdrop from the late 80s. His invention, the Oculus VR headset, looks like a goofy Johnny Mnemonic throwback at the best of times. Luckey, in the photo, appears to be headed to the socially maladjusted digital rapture. This led a lot of people involved in video games to implicate Time for the attempted murder of VR. The photo is cheesy, ridiculous, and plays into revenge of the nerds style stereotypes. If ever there was a button that could be pressed that would send all of games media into a frothing rant, that's it. Time Magazine pressed it, and the response was dishearteningly predictable.Video Games folks, as a collective culture, feels nothing more strongly than our deep sense of general inadequacy. When other facets of popular culture began garnering some small glimmering phantom of what might be called respect, games lagged behind. Movies are called films, books are called literature, and video games remain the butt of basement dwelling nerd jokes. Video games are barely 40 years old. For huge chunk of that time a person was represented by a stack of squares and a dozen colors. If you weren&rsquo;t on board with games early on, there was no way you would be won over by the abstract graphics and dismal audio. As the graphic and sound fidelity increased, so did the interactive complexity. Pac Man is operated with only 4 discrete inputs and all of them are marshalled by the player with a single joystick. Street Fighter 2 can represent recognizable characters and environments, but there are no fewer than 14 discrete inputs, and they can all be used in patterns, combinations, and timings to create thousands of interactive possibilities at any given moment. Even though fighting games may represent the deeper end of the complexity pool, games in general have become complicated enough to be frightening to those who didn&rsquo;t stay all in from the days of pong, or mario, or whatever their own particular onramp was. Since what we video gamers were doing seemed so impenetrable and foreign to people who didn&rsquo;t play video games, it was an easy avenue of ridicule. If you were in you were in, if you were out you were out, and both sides of this culture divide were wrong.The people that have been on board with video games for most of their lives have internalized that ridicule, and perceive any attack on video games, as an attack on our own identities. We rush to the defence of a medium that needs none. Here&rsquo;s the thing, that fight is over. No matter what anyone says for or against the respectability of video games or video game players, games are simply another vehicle of culture. Kids who grew up with Mario or Pikachu don&rsquo;t have a separate rung on the ladder of relevance for those characters. They exist alongside Mickey Mouse, Superman, Odysseus, and Huck Finn. The war, if there ever was one, ended decades ago. The generation that grew up alongside games, my generation, we can stop fighting now.Time magazine is still well respected, and maybe they were out of line depicting the founder of the newest frontier in digital interactivity as a weird shoeless geek on the most budget of holodecks. It really doesn&rsquo;t matter. The people who will pick up that technology and push it forward, the newest generation of gamers, they don&rsquo;t feel the sting of being slighted by a magazine. They don&rsquo;t understand fighting for the respectability of the medium. Video games are simply a part of their cultural landscape. Amazing games and interactive experiences will continue to be made by people who think they have something to say in the medium. Some of them will use VR headsets to tell their stories and make real their ideas. Video games will continue to grow and change and branch out, maybe in ways that are unrecognizable to those of us who were around when they started. But die? no were far beyond that now. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Miner 2049erI have never finished Miner 2049er. Even now, when emulation, level select codes, and other digital wankery, would make completing the last level of this game trivial, I still haven't finished it. I don't think that I want to. I first played Miner 2049er on an Atari 800 computer. I knew that it existed on other computers, because I would paw over all the game boxes at the local computer store compulsively. What I didn't know at the time, was that it had actually been written on the Atari 800. Like a lot of games from that era, it was ported to every object with a processor in it, but many of them have system specific changes, or concessions. The Atari computer version was created with such focused intent, that it's difficult for me to imagine the game any other way. At first blush, Miner 2049er looks like a Donkey Kong ripoff. There are platforms to walk and jump on. There are ladders to climb. A bulbous, hat wearing, protagonist is tasked with scaling navigating an impossible structure, one screen at a time. There are amorphous baddies that mindlessly march a set pattern and don&rsquo;t actively assail the player character. All pretty damning stuff. Really though, Miner 2049er and Donkey Kong are nothing alike.Donkey Kong is a sort of dexterity challenge. The players goal and path to that goal are perfectly clear, but navigating the games obstacles required fast reactions and quick thinking. Miner 2049er is a set of 10 puzzles. There is a time limit, but it is fairly generous. For the most part you can take your time and figure out how best to complete the variety of challenges on offer. Each level presents a different novelty from teleporters, to vats of radioactive waste, to scissor lifts, to cannons packed with TNT. The catch to these puzzles is that you must step on every platform tile in every level to win. Some levels have platforms that can only be reached by following a very particular path making the entire level a sort of navigation puzzle. Of course the main difference is that when Mario dies, he spins around and falls over, but when Bounty Bob dies he crumples into his hat like Super Dave Osborne. Now that&rsquo;s comedy.When I played Miner 2049er I had no manual and no one I knew played the game. There was no internet, so there was literally no way to ask someone what I was supposed to do on each level. If let&rsquo;s plays existed they were probably recorded on betamax taped and placed lovingly in shoebox under someones bed. I have only just yesterday learned that there was a code that could start you on any level that you wanted. I just played the game over and over until each level was etched somewhere in the reptilian portion of my brainstem. I reached the 10th level, the one with the cannon you load with TNT, several times, but I could never quite put it together. I didn&rsquo;t know at the time how close I was to finishing Miner 2049er, or I may have been enticed to complete it. I have held on to that as some strange mark of shame for all these years. It was a game I was good at, but one that I could never defeat. A low priority white whale. Now, decades since, I know that I could go back and finish it. I have seen videos of the game being completed. It would be so very easy. I think I would rather not. I think that one level I never beat makes this game a little more special. A tiny nagging memory of joy. It&rsquo;s small, simple and trivial, but it&rsquo;s mine. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI don't buy games on launch day. On the occasion that get a game during a kickstarter, or pre order, or buy a game that's in early access, I usually won't &nbsp;play it until weeks or even months after release. Partly that's because I have other things that need doing and my game playing time is limited. Partly it's because I'm really cheap and prefer to wait until games are on sale. The real reason though, is that I know a few things about creative work. I&rsquo;ve worked on projects with deadlines and projects with &ldquo;deadlines&rdquo;. Projects that seem to drag on for ages, even if you are technically on schedule. Had these projects been produce, you wouldn&rsquo;t have gone anywhere near them. They started to smell pretty funky after the 3rd round of client revisions. While you are working on those types of projects, you know it&rsquo;s a death spiral. There is no way that anything remotely resembling the initial concept pitch will ever exit the other side of the creative digestive tract. Still you work on it, hoping against all good sense and reason, that something good will come of all your work. When the deadline &nbsp;is dictated by someone with no idea how production is going, or worse, someone who does, but would rather not confront the client with the bad news that more time is needed, the result is inevitable. No one has ever shit a diamond.Recently Warner Bros. pulled the PC version of Batman Arkham Knight to, you know, finish it. I mentioned on twitter that I thought this was a brave move. Most of the media that I have seen weigh in on this particular bit of news seemed to think that the coincidental timing of the Steam reimbursement program might have had something to do with it. Only the threat of an economic squeeze could possibly have made them pull a game from the market. Of course, that makes very little sense. The amount of people who actually return defective products is incredibly low. Even if Warner Bros. had to pay a fee for each refunded copy of Batman, if 90% of their customers returned the game, the other 10% would cover the cost. Admittedly I don&rsquo;t have any real numbers here, and none of the involved parties are likely to release any, but there is almost no situation where they lose money continuing to sell this game. What they would lose, is customer respect. The recent series of Batman games has been very well received. They are solid fun narrative action games, that treat the Batman and surrounding cadre of characters with honest respect. Even in the age of the superhero blockbuster movie, this is uncommon. On the current consoles, this most recent release has also been well received. There have been criticisms of certain choices the developers made, but it is roundly considered to be a good game. The PC version was made available for sale in a state that most would call not done. Since the PC version of most games where the console is the main platform will only account for a small amount of the overall sales, it seems the PC port was done quickly and not especially well. PC port is sort of a misnomer. At one time a game might be programed and created for a vastly different architecture than the common x86 pc. Game consoles used custom processor chips, graphics chips, and even memory. Making that same game code run on a PC meant rewriting a lot of it to work with different architectures and libraries. They had to be truly ported. Current consoles are custom PCs. Specific parts, but none that are exotic. This Batman game, no matter what version, runs on a PC. Making anything takes time. If you want to make a thing with a bunch of other people working on it as well, it takes scheduling, and planning, and looking ahead. People are famously terrible at planning more than a few days, or even hours, into the future. Nothing ever happens just as you plan it, and the more flexibility you build into your schedule the better. People have built some things on this planet, and off of it, at a staggeringly massive scale. It can be done, but it&rsquo;s never going to go absolutely smoothly.The developers of Batman where given a deadline to release 3 versions of this game. The core of the different version of each game would be identical, but the specific edge cases inherent in the different platforms would require attention. Most importantly, they would require time. Time I would suspect they asked for and were not given. After already adding many months to the development time of the game, someone decided that on one specific date all of the versions of the game would be released. Of course I understand that at some point you need to stop creating a product and actually start selling it if you ever hope to make any money at all. The problem is, you need to be very upfront and honest about that. Early access and paid betas have proven that people are willing to put up with a lot, if you are honest with them. They will pay money for your broken game, if you admit with your palms upturned, that yes, this game is not going to work perfectly. What they won&rsquo;t do is forgive you if you lie to them. Pulling a game from the market until you can fix the problems with it is probably the closest to an apology as any consumer focused corporation will ever get. They will earn no money for selling this game, and they will have to pay to fix it. In the end the game will likely sell well and all of this will be forgotten. In another 3 months when the developers have had time to fix a lot of small bugs and glitches, the game will play as well as it ever will, but they will have missed the marketing blitz and other tie ins that likely dictated the deadline in the first place. We have to be ready for that. The timeline of months or years of potential game sales need to be built into the product from the bottom up. People will play your game, and love it, in ways that can&rsquo;t be predicted by blockbuster centric marketing. Trust that your customers are smart, and don&rsquo;t lie to them. If you need a bit more time, say so. I just hope that whoever made the decision to pull Batman from Steam, also wrote an apology to all the developers for releasing it when it wasn&rsquo;t ready.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tIf you have read any of my previous posts, you probably know about my custom arcade cabinet and the neverending saga of it&rsquo;s construction. I never really mentioned it, but I&rsquo;m sure at least one or two people have wondered how the games actually run on there. How do you take hundreds of games from the 1980s and 90s that used to inhabit several stacked circuit boards and reels of coiled wire each and make that fit into a smallish pedestal. The answer is emulation, and it&rsquo;s kind of a big deal. I&rsquo;ll cover the boring stuff first. Emulation usually refers to creating software that mimics hardware. Sometimes it is software that mimics other software, but typically software can be ported, or rewritten to work on different hardware, so emulating it isn&rsquo;t necessary. Hardware emulation is really what we are talking about here.Take for example an old hardware system like the Mattel Intellivision. The Intellivision was created in the late 70s and used some common processor chips of the era. It also contained a lot of resistors and capacitors, the sort of non-transistor electronic components that are prone to age related failure. The majority of the Intellivision machines that exist today were manufactured as cheaply as possible 35 years ago. This means that the failure rate for that hardware is very very high. Also the video and audio output of those machines is for a video standard that is largely obsolete, making it difficult to connect one of these boxes to a TV if you can even get it to start up. The only reliable way to play an Intellivision game is either through reverse engineered, newly manufactured hardware, or through a software emulator. Usually a combination of the two. Create a solid simulation of that old hardware in software, and the game programs will run just like they did before, only on modern hardware. This would all be hunky dory, except emulation of games is still a &lsquo;keep your voice down&rsquo; type conversation in the game industry. This is mostly because of the grey legality of it. Here is the problem. Video games are copyrighted works whose distribution rights are typically retained by a person or company, or even several companies. Making and distributing a copy of that game without receiving the approval of the rights holder, usually by paying them money, would violate those rights agreements. Depending on where you are in the world this may or may not be illegal. This has led a lot of people, usually the rights holders, to suggest that emulating games is illegal, since almost all emulation of games requires creating a copy of the original code. I&rsquo;m not a lawyer and I don&rsquo;t know what is and is not legal. In fact, it&rsquo;s been proven time and time again that a lot of lawyers don&rsquo;t really know what is and is not legal when it comes to emulating old software. An awful lot of the computers that people use to keep the lights on and maintain the public water supply require heavy use of emulation software. Reverse engineering a hardware system to run in software is not really the problem. It&rsquo;s often a practical necessity. I think it comes down to public perception. For a long time, and more importantly for a certain generation of people, video games were considered commercial amusements, and not creative works. They occupied a place in our culture different, and somewhat lower, than movies, music, or books. Preserving a working copy of Buzz Bombers, would be an unthinkable waste of human effort to some people. Rights holders eager to maintain a hold on their creations would often agree, just because it made the argument easier to win. Doing the work to maintain a running copy of an old game takes effort, but putting in the effort costs money they often couldn&rsquo;t be guaranteed to recoup, but allowing your work to be distributed without compensation doesn&rsquo;t make sense either. It was, in the past, occasionally easier to convince a judge that software emulation wasn&rsquo;t legal, and put off having to do anything at all about the situation. Then these old games were simply going to vanish into the wash of history.If you told someone that they couldn&rsquo;t read Frankenstein due to the original printing press rusting to powder, they would look at you like you were bonkers. New plates would be created and installed in an updated, faster, and more efficient press, and the book would continue to be sold, or distributed. People didn&rsquo;t stop buying Revolver because vinyl records became obsolete. A created work outliving its distribution medium is sort of the norm. Video games are the first medium to break the laws of supply and demand. With any digital work you have an infinite supply and a limited demand. Prior to copying games, people could of course copy music by recording tape to tape, but the nature of analog recording meant that each successive generation would suffer a loss in quality, eventually leaving you with ear grating noise. Even playing the original master tape would eventually wear it out. Computer data doesn&rsquo;t work like that. If you make a copy, it will be identical to the original. If you make a 100 copies, or a million copies, They will all be identical. When games were distributed in cartridges, or stored in large circuit boards, it made creating copies difficult, but not impossible, and the data on the chips would still never degrade, no matter how many copies you transferred to new chips. When you factor in emulation, you don&rsquo;t need the chips either. A software simulation of the chip is just as good as the hardware as far as the game is concerned. While this is disruptive economically, since nothing in human history has ever presented us with infinite supply and limited demand, it also means that video games will likely be the best preserved cultural artifact we have ever had. There are a very small number of games that depend so heavily on the original electro-mechanical hardware that they can&rsquo;t be accurately emulated, but everything else in the short 40-50 years people have been making or playing video games can be recreated on a relatively meager modern computer. At one time there were a lot of angry voices yelling that floppy copying would be the death of video games. It wasn&rsquo;t. There were a lot of the same voices yelling that emulation would be the death of video games. It&rsquo;s not. In fact it has introduced so many people to games they would otherwise never have seen or played, that playing old games has inspired countless new developers. Business have started and thrived based on making it easy to play older games. I have bought a lot of them. An awful lot. If you want to predict what will happen to music, or books, or any other analog turned digital medium, you can just look at the history of video games, because whatever the issue is, video game have probably dealt with it first, fastest, and maybe violently. When we start scanning vinyl discs, wax cylinders, and celluloid at a molecular level, maybe those mediums will enjoy the type of precise preservation that video games already do and no one will be tricked into thinking that attempting to preserve a work of art is illegal, because video games will have paved the way. \t\t"

In Twinkle Star Sprites you play as one completely ridiculous character selected from a roster of ridiculous characters. Each character rides on some sort of jet or robot or flying pig. Each flying monstrosity has different styles of attack pulled from every flying-shooting game from 1986-1996. You are shooting at friendly looking fluffy cloud creatures, attempting to get them to explode near enough to one another that it starts a chain reaction of exploding fluffy cloud things. Explode enough of them and it will send what appears to be an evil ghost comet streaking across the barrier between your playfield and your opponents. If you send enough of them your opponent will be overwhelmed and catch fire, ending in a looney tunes-esque charred husk with eyeballs. It&rsquo;s all stupid, it&rsquo;s all frantic, it's all incredibly fun.Twinkle Star Sprites is a game that should probably never have been made, and sincerely hope that a million more get made just like it. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tHere is a topic that I have thought of, and then passed on, several times. Buying video games. It&rsquo;s not the most sensational topic. Some might even call it dull. Pedestrian. This is just the standard day to day of any industry that sell products to people. Maybe, maybe not. Video games have had a unique convergence of circumstances that makes buying them right now really interesting. I&rsquo;ll try to explain.Video games are fairly new as creative media go. Games are as ancient as civilization, but video games are really only a few decades old. Almost as soon as they were conceived, they were marketed as products. This is not an issue faced by backgammon, or chess. Games, once upon a time, were not products. They were an activity between people. Rules would not be laid out by a designer, they would be decided upon organically by players. If you wanted to play these games you would construct a board and play them. If a rule didn&rsquo;t work, you changed it. Most likely you gambled on the outcome. If there was money to be made or lost on a game, it was in the gambling.Some folks reading this probably just had their nostalgia buttons triggered. The &ldquo;things were better when&rdquo; button. Lets just back that up a bit. Backgammon is somewhere in the neighborhood of 5000 years old, and while I don&rsquo;t know for certain, I would lay pretty good odds that the early versions of backgammon were garbage. That game was likely terrible through hundreds of years of minor iteration. People still play snakes and ladders, and that has never been a good game. In fact, snakes and ladders is not really a game at all. It is a hindu allegory for karma and predetermination. It was never intended to be a game, which is lucky for it, since as a game it is complete trash. Game design, like song writing, is a real tangible skill. Sure a good game can come from years of minute tweaking from countless individuals, but it&rsquo;s probably worth the money to pay a designer to create a game.Sometime between the 17th century and now, developing new games became an industry. They could be created, reproduced, packaged, and sold to people seeking novel entertainment. The rate of new games being produced increased every century, every decade, every year, until we arrive at present day, where the staggering onslaught of quality games flowing forth from talented game designers would probably kill a 3000 year old backgammon player dead with the pure awful shock of it all. Selling games had been nothing but good for the medium.Of course video games are not centuries old. They are a few decades old, and the scaffolding they are constructed on has been constantly changing the entire time. The technology used to create video games has grown so much in such a short time that stunning games from my own childhood look like cave paintings now. Strange digital farts and blocky stickmen were the height of electronic audio and video. People paid to comment on markets and the movements of money said that, like 8 track tapes, video games would be a weird fad confined to the late 70s and early 80s. Of course they were right. The technology in both those cases was destined to be superseded by more effective, superior, and more convenient technologies. No one suspected that music would be in danger if one distribution vector ceased to be viable. Video games are just games, a medium as old as civilization, repackaged in a digital form. They were never in any real danger. This new packaging is so very new though, that it is sometimes difficult to tell, even for people paid to comment on such things.Each generation of technology has been such a tremendous leap over the last that video games have yet to settle out. Board and card games have been able to depend on the reliability of the substrates they are printed on. They can work on the details of gameplay over several versions and iterations of the same game. There are modern day tweaks to the rules of chess. Video games have not had the same luxury. Every few years, the scaffolding a particular video game is built upon is torn away completely, and constructed anew. That experience is frozen in time. Shackled to the platform it ran on. Video games can be remade or reimagined, but not refined. At least not in the same way that board games can be organically evolved by the people playing them. This is why there is no video game equivalent of chess. If you have to reinvent the board for every new version, you might as well create chess 2. Hopefully the small tweaks you added will help it sell really well, since you will need all that money to finance chess 3, redone and reprogrammed from the ground up for the new consoles coming out in the fall. Video games have been a very short term gain proposition. Most of a games sales were in the first few weeks of release. After that, you had to get back on the treadmill. Churn out a new version, or a new game. Sell. Repeat. Here is where we come to the strange convergence we are at now. Computers continue to get more powerful by the nanosecond, but the main technology platforms are all basically the same. They vary slightly in the details, but they all run similar game code in similar ways. All the input devices are drifting closer and closer together. The methods of interaction in games are slowly but surely becoming standardized. Most importantly, a video game can now live forever. A game used to be confined to the hardware that it ran on, but now that hardware is no hardware at all. Games are distributed by, and, increasingly, run on, the internet, a highly abstracted software layer that can sit on all types and varieties of hardware. A single video game can now be maintained indefinitely with small, regular updates and patches. They can be services that a player can subscribe to for any amount of time that they choose. They can be delivered for free, and sold a few cents at a time to millions of people. They can, and do benefit from the digital model of infinite supply and limited demand. The self life of a video game can now be centuries. Buying video games is changing rapidly, in a sprawling mess of options. It is unlikely that a game designed today will ever, for any technical reason, be rendered obsolete. The scaffolds they are built on have become fluid and malleable.If there is a video game equivalent to chess, it is being designed and worked on today.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWe have one of those filter water pitchers. You know the ones. Clear and glossy plastic, you can put it in the fridge to keep your drinking water nice and chilly. We&rsquo;ve had it for quite a while. It carries the wear of years of daily use. It&rsquo;s fallen on the floor more than a few times, and has those unique features that only come from significant trauma. The most notable feature is that the top flap of the pitcher that you lever open with your thumb to refill it with water, that thing, it&rsquo;s thoroughly busted. The two tiny plastic pins that are meant to hold it in place have been long lost to some dark unexplored region. Under the oven most likely. We keep the flap on top of the pitcher to prevent debris or refrigerator flies or whatever imagined evils might enter our drinking water knowing full well that it&rsquo;s doing little good. The filter in the jug is designed precisely to remove such debris before it ever enters the drinkable water chamber. Still we keep the flap on there. Of course everyone who lives in this house is familiar with the pitcher and it&rsquo;s quirks. Without really thinking about it we all put our thumb or hand on the top of the flap when we pour. This keeps it in place and water comes out like it should. Any time a guest in our house tries to pour, they don&rsquo;t know about that particular protocol, and at least once during their visit the flap slides off the pitcher, and due to the precise angles and surface interactions involved, always ends up plunking down into their freshly poured glass of water. There is no outward evidence that the tiny pins are broken off, so there is no way for someone to know that their water will soon have a chunk of blue plastic floating in it. We here may be used to it, but this is still a poor user interface experience.I have been only using Blender for any and all 3d modelling tasks for the last few weeks. I had a comfort level with other tools that made most modelling tasks quick, but it was time to move on. Blender is being actively developed and tends to incorporate new technologies and workflows fairly quickly. The heavy hitters of 3D content creation tools, like Maya, ZBrush, and Houdini, will always get the newest technology first, but a lot of those technologies turn out to be weird gimmick tools that only a few people ever end up using. The core tools that actually see some use evolve slowly enough that even an open source project like Blender is able to keep up pretty well. The tools I was using are all pretty much stalled. They did a few things better than any other tools for a short while until everyone else caught up. I liked using them, but it was time to move on. Progress will not accommodate my comfort.I printed out list of hotkeys, kept the documentation open in another window, and proceeded to learn the ins and outs of Blender. More than once I found myself searching through tool specific forums for answers to issues I couldn&rsquo;t find documentation for. What I struck me as I was searching was the frequency of a specific kind of question and a specific kind of answer. The script goes like this. Q: I have used (some 3D program) and I am new to Blender. I was wondering how to do (some common 3D process)? or Where can I find (some common 3D tool)?A: Blender doesn&rsquo;t work like that. learn the hotkeys. Here is my problem with this thinking. Just because I know to hold the flap on my water pitcher with my thumb, doesn&rsquo;t mean that it isn&rsquo;t broken. It&rsquo;s broken because it doesn&rsquo;t follow the conventions that people who have dealt with water pitchers out there in the greater world are familiar with. Water pitcher design doesn&rsquo;t have to be identical, but if the behavior of a part of a well known system doesn&rsquo;t work in a predictable way, that user experience is not good. If I am not there to inform a user of my water pitcher that it functions in a way that is inconsistent with what they know of water pitchers, it is not the users fault or responsibility to puzzle that out.So my problem here, to be absolutely clear, is not with Blender. The program is ridiculously powerful, stuffed with features, and once you acclimatize, fairly easy to use. Blender is built on a foundation that in software terms is very very old. It suffers from the same issues that all old programs suffer from, in that features have been bolted to the side of it for so long that some parts of the program don&rsquo;t operate in ways consistent with the rest of the package. The interface uses more clicks and keypresses than it really needs to in places, but all this is so that existing users who are comfortable with the interface can continue to work from version to version with an easy learning curve. This is fair, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean that it isn&rsquo;t broken or that it can&rsquo;t be improved. The interface of Blender is far better than it used to be, but there are still a lot of places where it can be improved. I did come across a comment from one of the developers who said something to the effect that even minor changes to the interface are hard to do without breaking other parts of the program. It was at least a peripheral admission that he recognised a problem existed, but fixing the problem could take time. What&rsquo;s more, it might take some effort to come to any consensus on what the fix should be when it comes time to implement it. I hope that it is a move toward an interface that attempts to work consistently, and aims to teach new users how to navigate it, without the help of external documentation. On another note, I should probably just get a new water pitcher.\t\t"

Before I went to the meeting from this video I had committed to doing a short presentation on some topic as yet to be determined. I wasn&rsquo;t going to talk about building an arcade cabinet, or pedestal, or whatever it is I built. I was going to do a talk about some aspect of 3D modelling or something, probably box modelling or making a game ready model from a high resolution sculpt. Some sort of semi technical talk like that might fit the venue better, but giving a presentation about building something silly and frivolous is in itself silly and frivolous. In other words, right in my wheelhouse. But why would you keep reading my blather when you can watch it.&nbsp;Thank you to Craig for posting this video and thank you to the rest of the Calgary Game Developers group for allowing me a venue for this type of nonsense. &nbsp;http://www.calgarygamedevelopers.com/Here you go.       \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWhen I decided to disassemble the arcade stick that had been hastily constructed from happ controls sticks and buttons, some scrap wood with oil stains on it, and several liberally applied layers of paint to hide said oil stains, I thought it would be a couple week project. That was almost 7 years ago. The cabinet I designed and built to replace the arcade stick was originally intended to contain a modified original xbox. It has 3 shelves to hold any old consoles I had kicking around.7 years is a long time, and I gave the happ sticks and buttons away several years ago. Now the heart of the machine is a raspberry pi 2 single board computer running a stipped down linux. The sticks are Ultimarc Ultrastik 360 digital/analog programmable powerhouses that didn&rsquo;t exist when I drew up the router files to cut the cabinet. The screen, originally intended to be a large rear projection unit, is a cheap lcd mounted to the wall. &nbsp;Almost nothing about this cabinet is as I had originally planned. It works fantastically, the games play great, and I like how it looks. It feels good to be finished it. The next one I build might be made out of metal.     \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tA couple of weeks ago I was using a program called Flexisign. Flexisign, as the name would suggest, is a vector graphics program used mainly by the sign industry. Of course Flexisign isn&rsquo;t the only vector art program available. There are much better known and more widely used, and arguably more capable programs around, but Adobe Illustrator is the top dog. If you want to do design work, page layout, or technical illustration, you probably need to learn Illustrator. Even though there are a couple of vector drawing programs that predate Illustrator and continue to be popular, mainly Autocad, the industry standard is Illustrator. Different programs will have their own tweaks and quirks, but if you know Illustrator, you can probably sit down and start working on a different vector program like Flexisign. Illustrator is the lingua franca of graphic design.Why use Flexisign then, if Illustrator is the go to drawing tool for digital layout and design? Simply put, Flexisign speaks the same language as the equipment used in sign shops, or at least this particular sign shop. I have also used programs called Omega and Signlab, they all pretty much do the same thing. They tell the hardware what to do. When your hardware is tasked with cutting small shapes and delicate curves from yards and yards of, sometimes very expensive, vinyl, you want to make sure that there are no translation errors. When you have a machine that can take actual hours to print gargantuan sheets of brightly coloured graphics, you don&rsquo;t want to have to restart because the software had a hiccup 80% of the way through the job. While Illustrator may be the industry standard, there is also something to be said for using the right tool for the right job.While the machines are perfectly happy receiving their orders from Flexisign or Omega or whatever software you are using, the real stumbling block will always be with the person operating it. Illustrator is the standard, and so it can be expected that people will be very familiar, even comfortable, with the way that Illustrator works. As much as Flexisign is influenced by Illustrator, and as much as SAi, the developers of Flexisign, have tried to make it accessible for designers familiar with Illustrator, it isn&rsquo;t Illustrator. There are a lot of small jarring disconnects waiting for someone familiar with Illustrator when they go to use Flexisign. Getting over those hurdles and just accepting that this program will be different is entirely the responsibility of the operator. When I sat down to use Flexisign, I knew that it would be different, and I knew that I had a limited amount of time to ramp up and get used to the new tools. I was going to be taking over the work on many projects already well underway by another designer, and rather than try to do it my way, or even try to determine what my way is, it would smooth things out a lot if I just checked any ego at the door and did what the company, and the software, needed. There is a switch in my head that I can flip when I just need to knuckle down and learn something. When it&rsquo;s a situation like this, where the machines just needed to be fed new artwork at a pretty consistent rate, I don&rsquo;t seem to have too big a problem of just flipping that switch. By the end of two weeks of half days I had no trouble loading up the printer with new material and setting up all the correct parameters to spit out a steady stream of good quality prints. Setting up the artwork for the process in Flexisign seemed like working with a slight accent rather than in a whole other language. Of course this is all leading somewhere. I have written here, and griped often about my love hate relationship with Blender. I like everything that Blender is trying to do, but I disagree with some of the ways that it attempts to do it. Maya was not the first 3D program that I ever used, but it is probably the one that I have used the most. There is a reason why Maya is an industry standard. Maya isn&rsquo;t a toolbox, it&rsquo;s a method of building tools. Many people will only ever use the bare minimum of what Maya can do. They will use it as a toolbox, only applying the prebuilt tools to their task. In all honesty, that is primarily what I did with it too. I only used the tools provided, and didn&rsquo;t delve too deeply in the real power of Maya. Maya is a system, a language, and if you are clever enough you can create almost any tool you can think of using that system. If it is related to 3D graphics, you can probably build it within Maya. Maybe the same is true of Blender, after all the source code for the entire program is available to be perused. All I know is that when I tried to determine how one tool or another worked in Maya, the core mechanics of it where easily exposed. Blender, not so much. The thing is, It&rsquo;s not Blenders responsibility to do that. It&rsquo;s my responsibility to flip on the learning switch and just work the way the tool does. It&rsquo;s possible to check the ego and just swim downstream. I think I can credit Flexisign with loosening the rust on my learning switch. Or maybe it was setting up the Raspberry Pi 2 with all it&rsquo;s Linux funkyness. Whatever the case, I returned to Blender with a much more open attitude and just started learning. Of course if any of you reading this have ever worked with 3D software, Blender in particular, can probably predict if you just remember the hotkeys and start working the way it expects you to work, learning software is not really that difficult. I used to run back to the safety of Silo whenever I needed to model something, but I haven&rsquo;t fired up Silo, except to export files to Blender, in weeks. I suspect, after a while using Blender consistently, rather than sporadically like i had, I will begin to get comfortable again. I&rsquo;m never, ever going to use the right mouse button to select though. I&rsquo;m willing to learn, but there is a limit. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Street Fighter 2 Champion EditionWhen Street Fighter 2 came out I had no knowledge of the original. If I had seen the original Street Fighter at an arcade or a travelling fair or a convenience store, it made no impression on me. I did see it long after it&rsquo;s release in a restaurant in some small town in Manitoba. I remember it only because it was one of the deluxe cabinets with enormous analog pad contraptions rather than the 6 button layout most people have come to expect from Street Fighter games. The journey that brought that cabinet from Japan to small family restaurant in Canada must have been epic. One of the player 2 pads looked as though someone had been forcefully depressing it with a jackknife. I tried to play it and either I didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing or the kick pad on player one didn&rsquo;t work at all. Both cases seem likely. Also the game was terrible. This is the only machine of it&rsquo;s kind that I have ever come across, and by all accounts mine was not a unique experience.My first encounter with Street Fighter 2 was not all that different. There was a vanilla SF2 cabinet in my home town arcade and, for a while at least, not many people played it. There was another game in my home town at the time called Violence Fight. Violence Fight is awful. You play as one of 4 meaty stereotypes and you attempt to defeat the rest in hand to hand to foot to head combat. The characters all control like they are hip deep in a swamp and punches may or may not land depending on whether or not the machine felt like giving a crap. It&rsquo;s only redeeming features were that it had a character named Lick Joe and a large portion of the screen would be filled with the words GOON, GAGOON, and DAGOON when a fighter landed a particularly heavy blow. How and why that happened remains a mystery, as the game seems utterly hostile to skill or technique. Unintentional comedy aside, Violence Fight made me weary of any large character fighting game. Street Fighter 2 looked enough like Violence Fight that I was all too quick to sneer at it and walk away. I of course tried it, because I will try pretty much any game at least once. As soon as the enemy character launched magical fire from his hands, and it didn&rsquo;t seem to be a move I could replicate no matter what combination of buttons I mashed down, I wrote the game off as cheap and that was that. It wasn&rsquo;t very long after that first Street Fighter 2 game showed up that the same arcade got several more of the machines. This never happened. Why would an arcade want more than one of a game. All sat in a row no less. The two new ones had a different marquee as well. They were Street Fighter 2 Champion Edition machines. People were playing them. A lot. Somehow word had gone out through the ether that this was a good game. A game so good that a small arcade required 3 of the things to keep up with demand. Not only that, but no one had told me. I was completely out of the loop. I watched intently over the shoulder of several other kids as they contorted the joystick around and pounded on buttons. Every now and then one of them would launch that magic fire, or launch their character into the air, or spin across the screen in a dazzling bouquet of flailing arms and legs. I asked how? How did they know? How was this done? Someone had a photocopy from a magazine, EGM maybe? There seemed to be a bottomless bounty of secret skills and strategies in this game. For me, that changed everything.I started playing the SF2CE machine at the local 7-11. I would skate over there after work, after some event that kept me in town rather than heading back out to the farm, or just when I had nothing else to do. I would buy a liter of milk (because I was a doofus kid) and stand in my skates (see previous remark) occasionally playing as Ken or Blanka, but usually playing as Vega. Eventually they decided that they didn&rsquo;t want me wearing my skates in the store, so I would carry shoes in a backpack ready to switch so that I could go in and practice timing the charge up for Vega&rsquo;s roll attack. They kept that cabinet in there so long, and I played it so often, that I knew when another cabinet had different dipswitch settings. I have played an awful lot of Street Fighter and it&rsquo;s offshoots over the years. When they are played well, it is like high speed chess. They are the closest video games ever get to the combination of physical and mental&nbsp;synchronization&nbsp;required to play a sport. Street&nbsp;Fighter 2 Champion Edition is one of the best games ever. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThis week I have been working on finishing up Captain Joystick, my weird hybrid of arcade machine and sculptural home furnishing. I ordered a Raspberry Pi 2 to use as the brains of the machine and as of this writing I still don&rsquo;t have it working 100%. I dive back into Linux at least a few times a year. Each time I have to relearn a lot of command line stuff that I had forgotten. If I was using Ubuntu as a dev environment, or modelling with Blender, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a big deal. Linux would just be the same background noise as Windows. It would be the table that I set my work on. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter what your work table is made out of as long as it supports your work. Of course that is almost never the case. Every time I start up Linux it is usually to do something uncommon, and it always leads to uncommon problems. Did you know, for instance, that when you mount an external hard drive, a hard drive that used to be an internal drive that you scabbed from a dead netbook and hooked up to an ata to usb adapter to make it into an external drive, you have to make sure that it is fully spun up before Linux boots? If you try to attach it after it will have all sorts of fun problems. Did you also know that you can&rsquo;t mount it as ntfs and expect it to be recognized as anything other than read only? Even after you specifically remount it as read write? And even though it is possible to chmod the permissions as root, since the application you are using to access the drive can&rsquo;t run as root it isn&rsquo;t really helpfull to do so? How about finding out that if you install the ntfs-3g package and modify the fstab file to mount the drive using ntfs-3g, a file system driver specifically made to deal with ntfs drives formatted under windows, when this drive was formatted under Linux, and has only ever been used with Linux?It might sound like I&rsquo;m frustrated. I&rsquo;m really not. If I got into a boxing ring, I wouldn&rsquo;t be terribly surprised by punching. It&rsquo;s kind of what I signed up for. The Raspberry Pi 2 seems to be dealing with it&rsquo;s new position in the arcade machine fairly well. A few games have been played, and a few more tweaks and fights with Linux and It should all be up and running. Whelp, I&rsquo;m off to go a few rounds. Wish me luck. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI find myself spending a lot of time thinking about the past and the future. If you know me, you would be forgiven for thinking that this was due to my age. An earned sentimentality. In reality, I've always been this way. As interested in history as I am in what comes next. They are joined. There are no events, just a seamless flow from past to future.Recently I have, quite literally, revisited a part of my own past. I won&rsquo;t get too specific, but I have found myself doing things that I didn&rsquo;t think I would ever do again. Using tools and skills that I had once been fairly adept at, but had let rust and wither. It brings back memories, but more than anything it makes me think of the future. How far some elements of the business have progressed in my absence and the direction they are likely to go in at least the next few years. As I work and live, acquiring new knowledge and skills, I regularly think back and wonder what I could have done in a certain job, had I only known what I know now. What could I have accomplished. Of course the answer is, that didn&rsquo;t happen. I knew what I knew and I did what I did, and that was the way it went. If I hadn&rsquo;t done those things then I wouldn&rsquo;t know the things I know now. Just a seamless flow from past to future.The things I write here mostly concern video games, but since myself and video games are roughly the same age, my own history and the history of this medium enjoy some parallels. Now that I am actively developing video games, a lifetime, my lifetime, of thinking about, playing, and sometimes creating games is proving valuable. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s an easy trap to only look back, but If my recent adventure has taught me anything, it&rsquo;s that at this moment I know exactly what I need to be able to make the games I make now. In the future, today will be the past and I can look back on it and wonder what I was thinking, but again, I will be precisely where I need to be to make the things I make then.This has maybe gotten all a little bit too Doctor Who, but I&rsquo;m okay with that. Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll write something else. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI typically try to refrain from just talking up tools on here. The thinking goes, why would I go to the trouble of writing something without having some sort of thesis in mind. If I&rsquo;m just writing to talk up some program, then I&rsquo;m not really offering anything worth reading. Well stuff that nonsense, I&rsquo;m gonna sing the praises of my favorite image creation and editing program for a bit. If you make, use, edit, or otherwise deal with digital images, you owe it to yourself to download Krita. I&rsquo;ll even put the link right here https://krita.org/ . The first real image editor that I ever used was photopaint. The original version of Corel Photopaint. The really old one. Before that I had used some nasty pixel editors, microsoft paint, and even tried to wrap my brain around illustrator. They all sent me scrambling back to paper and pencil. Computers, it seemed, were just not yet ready to be image creation tools. At least not for me. That changed when I discovered what could be done with Corel Photopaint. Suddenly pixels were flexible, plastic things. phosphors could be lit and changed with ease. Multiple versions of the program were released, and I kept using that same original copy, partly because I had no money to upgrade, and partly because I just really liked the way it worked. A few years later, and I was going to school for art and animation, and everyone was using Adobe Photoshop. The gold standard in image editing. Photoshop is so dominant it has become a verb. People who have never dealt with the business end of a Wacom stylus will know what it means to photoshop something. Since I wanted to hang with the cool kids, I learned to use photoshop, and I learned to use the piss out of it. There are certainly people out there that have more experience using photoshop than I do. There are people who know the the toolset more intimately, and are just flat out better at using photoshop than I am. You don&rsquo;t need to drive NASCAR to put the peddle to the floor. Me and photoshop, we made some shit. I have tried some other image editors and image creators, but to tell you the truth, they were all poor replacements. Photoshop was still better at so many things than programs the likes of The Gimp, that I would be continually frustrated by the terrible user experience.I downloaded and tried Krita a few versions ago, and almost instantly I was done with Photoshop. Krita has grown by leaps and bounds since then, but even in that earlier state I think it was superior to Photoshop in many ways. Now, I think that Krita is better than photoshop in almost every respect. There are a few, excusable, slowdowns when working with large images, but it improves with every new version. And did I mention that all the new versions are free. Yeah, you can just go download them. It costs nothing. Even though it&rsquo;s free, I would willingly and gladly pay the very small amount they request in donations to keep the project running. In fact I have. I got a postcard from a russian software developer, so that was nice I suppose. You could offer me a free version of Photoshop at this point and I wouldn&rsquo;t be interested. Krita! Try it!\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThis past weekend I was helping a friend out with his comic expo booth. He had a few old cartridges, NES and ATARI, that he had decalled up to look like games that never existed. The ATARI cart was done up to look like a Predator game and the NES cart had a Walking Dead decal. While it was entirely possible that a deal for a Predator game on the ATARI 2600 was in the works, it never materialized on that system. The Walking Dead, of course, is a more recent development and would never have existed on either system. Several people through the day stopped to take a second look at them. They either pointed out the anachronism, and got the gag, or they picked up the cart with a puzzled look and asked if it was, in fact, a real game. When they were told that it was probably either RBI baseball or Krull stored in the chips of those cartridges, they smiled, but you could see them deflate a little. A few also went on to mention how they liked older games better than the current generation. I of course jumped into the conversation with both feet since there are few things I like more than talking about old games with fans of old games. Though I suppressed the urge to voice it, the thought of celebrating the past at the expense of the present or the future, still made me feel slightly sour.Of course it is really up to each person to decide what it is that they like, and I believe that they were genuine in their love of older games. It seems to me though, that denying the unfathomable bounty of games, and game types, that are currently available is sort of silly. It&rsquo;s like saying that no good music was ever produced past the decade you were in high school. That may be how they feel, but it&rsquo;s also sort of sad. Being a person who sees game mechanics in most things, I briefly entertained the idea of &nbsp;creating a real version of the games on that table. I considered what type of game would be made of The Walking Dead on a NES machine. It seems like something that would fit right in. Maybe a side scrolling zombie fighting game, Contra or P.O.W with zombie enemies. Maybe a sort of Sim City, but with a survivor's camp to manage. Each of those would take work and time. While it might be fun, you could never turn it into a marketable product without the blessing of the individual licence holders. My work and time could also be put into creating something original. I could even make something referential of old games, or properties like Predator, but if I&rsquo;m creating something, I might as well make it my own.While I still enjoy a lot of older games, and I like a lot of rertro styled games that are coming out now, I think that when a game really works is when it feeds that nostalgia without being a slave to it. The past 30 or 40 years of game development is available to be mined, but incorporating new ideas and new developments into retro style games can lead to the creation of something truly unique and amazing. While I won&rsquo;t be making a Predator game that runs on an ATARI 2600, it might be a fun challenge to image what that game would look like and then build something similar using all the new tools and techniques available. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI know almost nothing about the intricacies of graphics programming. I don&rsquo;t know how to swizzle a matrix or whatever it is graphics programmers do. I know that swizzling is a real thing, and I think I may have even done it once or twice, but I&rsquo;m not sure I could tell you exactly how or why. I don&rsquo;t have the words.I recently updated a shader I had created so that it would work in Unity 5. There were some small bugs that previous version of Unity were fine with, but the latest version just could not abide. Every object using this shader would come up fuchsia. Fuchsia is a terrible color. That&rsquo;s why it is used to spotlight an error. No one would ever willingly use fuchsia. To some part of our lizard brain, fuchsia means broken. The bugs were relatively minor, but it still took me quite a while to track them down and fix them. Not because the shader is particularly complex. It isn&rsquo;t. It was because, even though I had created this shader entirely from scratch, adjusted and set each variable, and used elements of the render engine in ways that, at least I, think are somewhat clever, I had never actually looked at the code.I used a visual, node based shader editing tool to author the shader. I can already picture the indignant sneers of the coding grognards out there. There is a contingent of the game dev community who even regard a pre made game engine, Unity Unreal and the like, as if it were an especially pungent cheese. I may not have made the most inventive or precision tuned shader ever, but It creates a look that was not available through any simple means. It is unique, and while it may be a problem that a very few people have, the shader solves a problem. That&rsquo;s what good tools do.I occasionally drift into the wonderful world of linux, unix, dos, and command line interfaces. I grew up using the command line. My childhood was populated with computers that were completely impenetrable to the uninitiated. Flashing cursor boxes and arcane commands like LOAD &ldquo;*&rdquo;,8,1 were common. I still habitually type ls when I mean to type dir. Z80 basic is a major part of my construction as a human. I have it in me to be the uber geek that looks down his nose at gui based tools, yet I bristle at the comment that using the command line is more efficient.I have driven many stick shift vehicles. They are not more efficient than driving an automatic. A practiced driver can accomplish things with a manual transmission that an automatic vehicle might not be capable of. They have more options available, but I think it is important to never mistake options for skill or efficiency. The learning curve of an automatic vehicle is significantly smoother. It lets the driver get better faster. Knowing how and when to shift gears is much less important than learning to be a good driver. I view writing code in much the same way. I often find that variances in syntax hold me back more than the actual problems I&rsquo;m trying to solve. Since I&rsquo;m not hip deep in the programming language of the day, I spend most of my time looking at documentation, and a small amount of time actually writing code. Gui based development tools are like an automatic transmission for code. The learning curve is smoothed out. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s not important to know what is going on under the hood. Since I had created the shader, even if it was with a gui based editor, I was able to walk through the code looking for landmarks that I had placed to ferret out the offending bits. Creating the program in a streamlined way allowed me to better understand what was actually going on in there. If I had sat down with openGL documentation and a book on shader programming, I would probably still be sitting there with no shader to show for it. As it stands, I have it running in two versions of the engine and I&rsquo;m well on my way to making it work with the new Unity lighting model. Even now I feel like I&rsquo;m being overly defensive of visual scripting and programming systems. There is a part of me that use to set up batch renders using small unix scripts that feels like shader editors and node based graphical programming is a cop out. It&rsquo;s coding for babies. Maybe it is, but babies learn faster than any other human, and they learn by testing the world and getting feedback. They don&rsquo;t learn by building up layers of theory that they eventually employ in one triumphant effort. Test, receive feedback, adjust, test receive feedback, adjust. That is what these tools let you do. Mostly I am just trying to justify buying Shader Forge, since the free shader editors don&rsquo;t work in in Unity 5. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Caverns of Khafka (for Atari computers)Caverns of Khafka feels like a game that could shake apart at any moment. Is it possible to glitch your character clean through the floor of the level and crash the game? Probably. Can you get your character up into the scoreboard area of the screen and run around on top of the numbers? Absolutely. It seems like maybe this game shouldn&rsquo;t work at all. It seems like the game was slapped together with very little thought. You might think that, until first blind pit you get to. A few ledges down from where the character starts, there are two choices, the left or the right pit. The bottom of both pits exists just off the bottom of the screen. If you choose the left pit, the screen will scroll up to reveal lava. You will fall into the lava and die. The right pit is clear, and would have been the safe choice. If you instead choose the right pit, you will find that it is filled with lava and the left pit is clear. When you start the game, both choices are wrong. This only happens once, after you choose one pit, and die in the lava, for the rest of that play through the pit with lava and the pit without will remain locked. There is a way to reveal the lava without dying, but it involves navigating to the far side of the map and back again.As soon as you figure that out, you realize. This game isn&rsquo;t broken. This game is fucking with you. Not only that, It&rsquo;s inviting you to play along. There are areas that can only be reached if certain, nebulous requirements are filled. There are areas that can only really be reached by glitching through walls. Some traps are rhythmic and predictable. Some are erratic and random. They often mix together. Careful movement and patience are your main weapons.Caverns of Khafka takes place entirely in one very small playfield, but discovering all the fine intricacies of it&rsquo;s design takes many repeated attempts. All the while you are left wondering if there is a slightly better way to glitch your character through that wall.        \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI hate rendering. Can&rsquo;t stand it. I would be positively ellated to never have to render anything ever again. That leads to the obvious question. What is rendering, and why do you hate it so much? Since a lot of my past work has been in 3D graphics and animation, the context from which I invoke the word &ldquo;rendering&rdquo; is probably important. Rendering is when you, as a digital artist, ask the computer to please take all of the 3D models, texture maps, particle effects, and lighting trickery, and pass the whole mess through some sort of prettying sieve. The pixels extruded out the other side of this process should be in the order that you expected, or at least arranged nicely. Depending on the renderer you are using and what you tell it to do, you can get all sorts of different looks, anywhere from photorealistic, to pre playstation 1 era polygon soup. Every computer generated image had to pass through a renderer of some description. Some just light up the screen pixels you suggest to the rendering software might need lighting up. Others read the geometry in the scene and calculate the way that light bounces around the objects turning each impacted surface into a new light source, with it&rsquo;s own colour and scatter parameters. The thing calculates the movement of light. No matter how efficient the calculations are, that&rsquo;s a job that is going to take some time. I used to dread rendering. When you first start a scene there are only a few simple objects in it, and the instructions for how to colour and light them are usually fairly simple. Rendering software could take less than a second with a scene like that. Maybe you can even have the scene render at near realtime, at 10, 20, or 30 frames per second. Testing animation, geometry and lighting setups is a pretty brisk affair at this sort of speed. Add a few more objects and some nice high resolution textures and the framerate plummets. Soon it&rsquo;s taking several seconds per image to render. You can still work and iterate on a job at that speed, but you are usually one or two additions away from it taking several minutes per frame. Now you have to do tiny spot renders. Maybe just check the top of a lamppost, or only the last few frames of a walk cycle. Rendering an entire animation is no longer feasible. That is usually the precise moment when a client will ask for a major timing revision, or a camera angle change. You proofed and got a signoff on all this stuff when the render time was a few seconds per frame, now that making changes eats up the whole afternoon you need to do a 45 degree rotation to the camera pointing it at something you haven&rsquo;t textured yet, and they need the new render by the morning. Now you might be seeing why I hate rendering. Pixar and ILM have massive refrigerated rooms full of computer hardware to tackle this problem. A render might take minutes, or even hours per frame, but if you split that up over 200 cpus, 500 cpus, several thousand cpus, you should be able to see the results of any changes right quick. If you are working on one machine in an advertising shop, 15 minutes per frame is a recipe for a bad time. Over the past few years I have been using game engines. Game engines use a renderer to put graphics to the screen, but games prioritise speed over beauty. Games have to spit out 30-60 frames every second just to remain playable. The ones that dive below that suffer the ire of players and reviewers. For years we have been hearing that new graphics software and hardware will allow a game to look like a Pixar movie. Depending on how you view that moving goalpost, Pixar is still working to make their movies look better too after all, games may never get there, or they may have gotten there around Ratchet and Clank Future. Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction came out in 2007 and it&rsquo;s still wall to wall gorgeous. I recently loaded a very high polygon model that I had been working on into the Unity 5 engine. The recent addition of an advanced lighting system made the model look fricken beautiful before I even did any advanced processes to it. I could make changes, move the camera anywhere, and change the lighting all at roughly 30 fps. The same model took several minutes per frame to render through the Blender Cycles renderer, even with hardware acceleration turn on. The visual difference between the images that came out of Cycles and the Unity renderers did not justify the extra time. The Unreal and Crytek engines can do similar quality images. I don&rsquo;t think I care how pretty the latest Renderman derivative can make a scene look. I&rsquo;ll be using game engines to render everything in the future.There is a slightly higher learning curve to getting things running smoothly in a game engine, but I figure if a person took the time to learn Maya or 3DStudio they probably won&rsquo;t have much trouble navigating game asset requirements. I still hate rendering, but I think I like where it&rsquo;s headed.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThere are a lot of great digital tools available now that let creators work in rapid, iterative ways. We owe a lot of the progress made in the last 40 years to the humble &ldquo;undo&rdquo; command.The undo feature of most software is second nature. We roll our fingers across Ctrl-z like we pick lint from a shirt. Removing a minor misstep from digital work is mundane. There are usually several levels of undo and redo and we can walk back and forth through the past at will. This ability has advanced human creativity explosively. Attempting and testing new ideas in visual arts, music, literature, science, engineering, medicine, frankly every industry touched by a computer, comes at very little risk. Undo isn&rsquo;t an eraser. Undo is the freedom to make mistakes while appearing to all the world like you&rsquo;ve made none. Like most tools, there is a downside to undo. The ease of undo can sometimes make us forget that every creation has an end point. Usually several end points, laid out in intervals along the path toward a finished work.Even the most well thought out workflow passes the point of potential undo. There are barriers that need to be crossed when digital information is converted from one form to another. Separate instrument tracks need to be mixed into a single recording before you can present it as a song. Visual effects need to be blended into filmed footage, and the footage must be edited, before it can be presented as a movie. When someone works with physical materials, the understanding that changes can be irreversible is inherent. If you tear paper or cut wood while creating something new, that change is permanent. Almost everyone has, at least some, experience with computers, and almost everyone has used undo. There is a rampant perception that digital creation tools, like photoshop, contain within them a turbocharged version of undo that allows those in tune with it to access a world of infinite malleability. The truth, of course, is that at some point along the way wood gets cut, metal gets melted, paper gets marked, and digital files get converted. The process is always one way, and undo is not possible. When undo is so readily at hand for everyone, the belief that creators can revert changes and modifying anything without limit, usually follows. Most creators will understand the limits of their tools. Unfortunately, their clients rarely will.Educating clients, calling out the points of no return in the production process, has never been my strong suit. People never like to hear that something can&rsquo;t be done without significant difficulty. Significant difficulty usually translates into more time and more money. This can make it uncomfortable to raise the issue. Of course that usually means eating the time and cost when a client requests late stage changes. Changes past the point where undo was ever useful. There is also the problem of creator ego. It&rsquo;s nice to be able to just say &ldquo;OK&rdquo; and turn around the changes as requested, making you look like a master of your craft. In the end, it would probably be healthier for everyone if clients could be gently educated to the cold hard facts of production. You can measure twice and cut once, but after you cut, there is no undo. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI watched An American Werewolf in London on a CED when I was a kid. You could go and ask your grandpa what a CED is, but for the sake of this story, I&rsquo;ll fill you in. CED was a weird sort of video record that came in a plastic case. The machine that played these discs had a long, narrow, covered slot that you would put almost the entire plastic case into. The machine would grab hold of the disc, and you would remove, the now empty, plastic case from the machine. The discs only held 60 minutes of video per side, so around halfway through a movie you would have to flip the disc over. Since exposing the disc to the outside world in any way would apparently cause a tear in reality, that meant you needed to slide the case back into the machine. The disc would be delivered by some arcane mechanics back into the plastic case, and you could pull it out, flip it over and put it back in again to finish the movie. Laserdisc players that could play both sides of a disc without flipping and long play video tape also existed at the time, so this obviously stupid practice of flipping the disc died with the CED format, and we were all better for it. I only remember this, because I was scared to flip the movie to side 2. Billed as a horror comedy, An Werewolf in London is actually a strict horror movie right down to it&rsquo;s core. The comedy is layered around it as seasoning. It&rsquo;s a movie that knows what it is, and goes for it. The scares are scary, the gore is gruesome, and the tension is high. Of course it is also an extremely funny movie, but that never gets in the way of the films intent. It is constructed around fear. Recently I have been playing Wolfenstein The New Order. It is a big, dumb, loud, action spectacular of a game, but in the corners it is also one of the most finely realized, touchingly written and presented games I can remember playing. It only works because this is a game that knows what it is.I have written before that I had some real problems with the way that the story of games like Uncharted and Bioshock Infinite betray the gameplay that they are ostensibly created to support. Characters and events that carry one very clear tone in the story, lie at hard angles to the actions the player must execute to succeed at the game. The whole is weaker for it.Wolfenstein The New Order shifts seamlessly from one speculative fiction melodrama to another. The characters remain true to their, occasionally thin, personas. Peripheral events are handled with a subtlety and humanity that is usually reserved for much slower paced games like Gone Home. Through all this, the story is never asked to upstage the bombastic and harried action. There are several successful horror comedy films. An American Werewolf in London, Shaun of the Dead, and Tremors, are a few of my favorites, because they know what they are and remain horror movies first. I suspect that if a joke in the script of any of these movies stood counter to the tension, it was cut or altered. It has the net effect of making all of these movies seem more human and heartfelt than any of the Saw sequels. Games are a tricky storytelling medium. There are always two stories running in any game. There is the story that the developer has written for the player, and the story that the player is creating through their actions. Some games, like point and click adventures, limit the players actions to put the focus more heavily on the written story. Some, like roguelikes and sandbox games, mute the creators intended narrative in favor of the story the player creates. If a developer wants to influence both, the two threads at the very least, need to agree with each other on tone. If the game is an over the top action shoot fest, the writers have to respect that intent. There are plenty of places that comedy, tragedy, terror, and humanity can support such a game. The creators just have to stay acutely aware of what sort of game they are making.Take a lesson from the doomed CED player. You can&rsquo;t get more narratively at odds than making someone to get up and flip a disc over to play media that&rsquo;s main ask of it&rsquo;s audience is that they sit quietly and focus for two hours.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI&rsquo;ve been doing some 3D modelling recently. It&rsquo;s something I have been doing with varying degrees of success for almost 20 years. You would think that I would have it down by now. You would think that I would just do the job with no issues or stress. You would think that I would have worked out strategies for dozens of potential problems. You would think that I would fly through a project and rarely have to backtrack or repair blunders. You would think that I would have confidence in my own experience and abilities.What I have is fear. Not a crippling fear. Not a fear that stops me from attempting new things. It&rsquo;s a low level, pervasive fear. It&rsquo;s the fear that I can&rsquo;t do what I said I could. It&rsquo;s the fear that everyone is better than me at almost everything, and I have been fooling anyone who thinks otherwise. It&rsquo;s the fear that I will be found out as a fraud, and that everything I create will be sub-standard. This fear usually doesn&rsquo;t stop me, but it does slow me down. I can usually even recognize when it is slowing me down, but it is sometimes difficult to overcome it.I have amassed a portfolio full of evidence that I am capable of modelling objects, animating, sculpting, constructing, working out solutions to problems. Occasionally I will look at some of it and feel like a real cool guy who knows how to do things and is really awesome at stuff. That lasts until I start on something new, and then it&rsquo;s all fear all the time. I usually spend way too long looking up the solutions devised by other people. Seeking help or advice when I honestly don&rsquo;t know how to do a thing is probably a smart move, but when it is just fear directing me with feelings of inadequacy, it&rsquo;s just a huge waste of time. There is almost always a point in all of these projects that were slowed by fear, where I realize that the obstacles I was afraid of tackling have very simple solutions. Usually solutions that I am already very familiar with. Solutions that I have implemented time and again on other projects. I tend to get a lot done in a very short amount of time when this happens. I usually marvel at how trivial the problems holding me back turned out to be. I&rsquo;m going to have to work harder on squelching minor fears. I&rsquo;m going to have to be better at harnessing that feeling when I overcome the fear and move forward. I think this is probably the most challenging problem I consistently come across in all the work I do. Overcoming fear is my full time job. Anything else I accomplish is consequential.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - The Last StarfighterI used to play a ton of games on an Atari 800 computer. I&rsquo;m fairly certain that only a few of the games were legally purchased. I&rsquo;m certain of that, because the most of the games had labels hand written on generic floppy disks in marker. Legit manufacturers tend to use printed labels and usually limit the games to one per disk. In order to play a lot of the games you needed to defeat the cartridge door sensor by jamming a piece of wadded up paper in a hole in the top of the computer and flip a switch embedded in a special cartridge called the pill. The custom menu created for each disk would list the games written on it and instruct you when to flip switch. While you might have moral reservations about the state of software piracy in the late 80s and early 90s, you have to respect the ingenuity of it all. Some clever folks cracked copy protection with the help of a device that would not look out of place in a cold war era cockpit. This is important, because, as I have learned, going through this arcane process of switch flipping and disk pirating might have been the only way to play this particular game.         Obviously I have some nostalgia for this machine and its games. I thought that perhaps my love of the game The Last Starfighter was just a part of that. Some relic of a game that wasn&rsquo;t really all that great tied to the joy only a child can derive from a decent, but thin space cowboy action flick, add some rose tinted glasses and let simmer for decades.A few years ago I became aware of a project to recreate the game from The Last Starfighter. Not a game based on the movie. The game. The arcade game that Alex Rogan plays. That CG miracle that could not possibly have existed in 1984. It looked like a game that could possibly exist in the distant future. Well turns out the means now.&nbsp;http://www.roguesynapse.com/games/last_starfighter.php         I&rsquo;ve tried this game out during many stages of it&rsquo;s development. The accomplishment by RogueSynapse is not to be taken lightly. They created a real game that looks and feels just like the one you see in the movie. More than that, the game actually works as a game. There is a goal, stages, a sense of progression. To take a few seconds of film footage and reimagine that as a functional game, is amazing.&nbsp;Is it better than the version I played on the atari 800? No, no it&rsquo;s not. I went back and played them both. The Last Starfighter is for the atari computers was and still is a fun action / light strategy game. The almost movie perfect recreation, is a tad dull. The newer version has almost everything over on it&rsquo;s older cousin. Graphics, sound, nostalgia factor. Everything except being a fun game. For that you have to go back to the old Atari computers.I learned during my research for this post that the game I played on the Atari 800 computer all those years ago was actually well into development under the name Orbiter before the movie license was attached to it. It was later released as The Last Starfighter, and then again as Star Raiders 2. The final name probably suits the game best, since it shares a lot with the Atari classic Star Raiders. The same action/strategy mix played from a first person, space shooting, perspective. I played it again as Star Raiders 2, and do you know what? Still fun. Still fun.&nbsp;I knew it as The Last Starfighter and it&rsquo;s one of the best games.         As an addendum, I found this while perusing the web this morning. This is a retail product that needs to happen.http://www.davidglennsimmons.com/archive/MyLegoCreations/Gunstar.htm       \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tAt this years Global Game Jam I had the opportunity to try out the Oculus Rift DK2 (development kit version 2). I had tested out the original Oculus dev kit last year, and while the experience was striking, a few minutes was about my limit. I&rsquo;m not someone who is prone to motion sickness. I like roller coasters and theme park rides. The most disoriented I can remember a ride making me feel was the Orange Team version of Mission Space at Disney World. The one that spins you up to 2.5G and then bounces you a round for a little while. Even after that ride, I was only dizzy for a bit during the disembarking stage, where they have you walk down a long air conditioned hall likely as a counter to these effects, before you are herded back out into the oppressive Florida heat. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to ride it several times in a row, but It was pretty easy to shake off the effects before lining up to ride Test Track for maybe the third time that day. Test Track is really really fun. I didn&rsquo;t say all that so that you would think that I was some tough manly man. Far from it. My body has a reaction to over consuming alcohol that I would classify as violent. My tolerance for poisoning is very low, but my reaction to motion induced poison simulation is mild. I just wanted to lay out a baseline measurement of potential nausea. The first time I tried the Oculus version 1, while sitting stark still in an office chair for maybe less than 5 minutes was about the same a riding the Orange Team side of Mission Space. I was fine, but a few minutes more and I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have been. When I first tried the DK2 it was with a demo that didn&rsquo;t use the new positional tracking that was added to this version. The original headset tracks the rotation of your head around an axis that the simulation assumes is your neck, but not your position is space. This new one can track both. That demo left me feeling that same sort of disorientation, but maybe softened slightly by the increased resolution and response time of the display. Once we got the thing running with the new positional tracking though, it was like the thing came with it&rsquo;s own gravol.Every person is going to react to these head mounted displays differently, but whatever the disconnect my brain was experiencing without the addition of positional tracking, that just evaporated as soon as it was turned on. Everything in the virtual world I was experiencing seemed locked into place. The first demo was a lazy, drifting flight experience over a medieval town. This one was AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity, a hyperactive base jumping game where you plummet at high speed through a floating city. This a game that makes people sick when they play it on a screen. All I felt was joy. According to Oculus, the worst culprits causing motion sickness are latency and persistence, or how fast the device reacts to your movements and displays the right information and how quickly the display can react to the information the computer is sending it. Smeary ghosting images and laggy input are apparently in full effect in the DK2 prototype. The newest version of the headset has, by all accounts, solved these issues. They don&rsquo;t even seem to be problems that bothered me, but hell, better is better right. I was pretty sure I wanted to get one of these things when the eventual full retail version is available, but now that I know I won&rsquo;t have to use it while chewing on ginger root, I&rsquo;m double or maybe even triple sold. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tAt this years global game jam I did something I haven&rsquo;t done in way, way too long. I animated. Sure I only animated a hand, and sure it really wasn&rsquo;t very detailed, nuanced, or &ldquo;good&rdquo;, but when you only have a couple days to create an entire game, you do what you can. I harbour a perpetual displeasure aimed directly at Blender. It&rsquo;s not fair really. Blender is one of the most astoundingly capable open source projects ever developed, likely eclipsed only by Linux or Apache. As far as my personal evaluation goes, Blenders only real downside is that it is not Maya. Again, not really fair. Still, not being Maya has stopped me from using Blender as much as I probably should. It took me until this game jam to attempt wrapping my head around rigging in Blender. I have created a couple of rigs in Blender previous to this jam, but they were all test rigs and simple tutorial stuff. Nothing that I would actually want to animate with. Nothing I would be confident exporting to another system. A game for example.By the way, going through some of the tutorials for blender rigging after getting a mental grip on how it works, there are some folks out there who really don&rsquo;t know what they are doing and their &ldquo;tutorials&rdquo; are a psychological speed bump for anyone eager to learn. I&rsquo;m rarely ever confident enough in what I know about a topic to put together a tutorial, and these people illustrate why I&rsquo;m probably not wrong about that. Can we draft an accord between instructors and students that states:&ldquo;This is not the definitive way to do this thing that I am showing you. This is an example of the broken way that I do things, and you would do well to seek your own way. Please ignore every instance where I emphatically state my expertise on this topic. The truth is no one knows, and anyone who claims to should be thrice examined with a wary eye.&rdquo; &nbsp;This time though I had picked up a new plug in for Unity called Skele. This meant that I could rig and bind a model in Blender, but I could animate in Unity. Unity shares a lot of UI elements and workflow concepts from Maya, so animating directly in the game authoring tools seemed friendlier. The real benefit was, since I was doing all the animations right in the Unity environment, the animations files pumped out were instantly available to the running game, being developed by another person on a different computer. Animation files, when handled properly, are really just glorified text files. Lists of joints and their rotations at certain time intervals. The game engine takes care of displaying the resulting character movements and deformations. The files Skele puts out could easily be put into a file repository somewhere on the internet and distributed to a team working from pretty much anywhere, without the need for the animator to be there making sure that exported file formats like fbx and collada are being imported and interpreted properly. Game jams are pretty much failure central. At least one thing you come up with on the first day will fail spectacularly enough that it, or any number of other things, will have to be cut from the game. That&rsquo;s just the way it is. You only have 48 hours to slap all this jazz together, and you may want to eat and sleep sometime in there as well. You will try something, it will fail, and you will ditch it. The upside is, you might as well try anything, since who knows, maybe that will be the thing that actually makes it into the game. Once in a while something you think might fail, works so well, and implements so smoothly, that you will wonder why you haven&rsquo;t been doing it all along. A few years ago I built an entire enemy AI system using Playmaker, a visual state machine editor, and it could not have gone smoother. I think I commented at the time that the AI was about the level of an incredibly stupid roomba. The fact that I had never attempted anything like that before, but it got in the game, and it worked consistently, made me reconsider how I use Playmaker. Going forward I will be doing quite a lot of animating with Skele. Next time I&rsquo;ll try to make it something more interesting than a hypnotically undulating hand.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tYears ago I heard Jim Zubkavich posit a theory he called The Wheel of Crap. The Wheel of Crap states that any media has two opposing potentials, Great, and Crap. Great sits at the top of the wheel, Crap sits at the bottom, and the two states form a continuum. Almost every human endeavor will begin at Crap. Through the application of creative force and dedication, the needle on The Wheel of Crap will begin its upward march toward Great. Depending on the ambition of that initial idea, it may require a lot of effort or very little. Cooking a decent grilled cheese sandwich, for example, requires very little effort. Apply too little effort and may get up to good, but you won't reach Great. Apply too much effort and you will be on your way down to Crap again. A grilled cheese does not need foie gras and questionably harvested oils. Despite, or perhaps because of the effort, that sandwich would be crap. There are some edge cases that are explained nicely by The Wheel of Crap. Plan 9 From Outer Space, Road House, and Escape From New York all applied such tremendous force to the wheel that they did the full revolution back up toward Great. Plan 9 likely spun it a few times. I was asked a few times at a recent Calgary game developers meetup, how the game that I had presented several meetings (read months) ago was shaping up. I had to proudly thrust my chin forward and proclaim that what I was working on was indeed crap. And that&rsquo;s ok. While Jim has proven himself to be a master of the wheel, I still struggle with it on an almost daily basis. There is evidence littering my my past works that seems to indicate that I can, on occasion, push the wheel hard enough and long enough to create something pleasant to look at. I have every reason to believe that these weren&rsquo;t flukes. It is possible for me to pivot the wheel into a positive heading. Right now, the game as it stands, is crap. But understanding the wheel, and how it works means that, while it may be crap now, good or even great may be in it&rsquo;s future. This is one of those posts where I&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;really have a point. So I&rsquo;ll just stop here.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI was thinking about some old games the other day, as I do. I was remembering Fighting Vipers, and it&rsquo;s sequel Fighting Vipers 2. These are some games that were never very popular, overshadowed by the far more successful Virtual Fighter series created alongside Fighting Vipers by Sega&rsquo;s AM2 arcade development division. Virtua Fighter is a precision tuned fighting game, built to go head to head with the Street Fighters and Tekkens of the genre. This a genre that contains as a staple, mystical martial arts experts that throw fire from their hands, so weird is relative. Whatever you might think of Virtua Fighter though, it&rsquo;s, odd duck, little brother Fighting Vipers, is weird. And weird games are great.I don&rsquo;t know if there is another medium that has such a deep set tendency toward weird. I think it comes down to capability. Early on, video and computer games had to rely on a healthy dose of disbelief suspension. When you tell me that tiny pointillist light smear is Mario, I&rsquo;m just going to have to choose to buy in. Before that, the hero in Atari&rsquo;s Adventure was represented by a single square. Four edges, four corners, defeats a dragon. These were the limitations at the time so going weird or abstract is built into video games at the molecular level. Now that there are mid to high end PCs powering every facet of the industry, a character that could be mistaken for an actual human is possible. We haven&rsquo;t seen one yet, but it is possible. Here is where we hit a crossroads. There are a lot of developers that would love nothing more than to hear a player say &ldquo;that looks real&rdquo;. While it might be an interesting challenge to take on, a mountain to climb, I think it&rsquo;s worth asking if realism is a thing that anyone really wants.I can remember all the fun I had playing Fighting Vipers, or Saint Row 3, or Katamari Damacy, and I can remember being so glad that those games were weird. Weird in a way that evoked their evolution from the earlier days of Adventure, where a square could be anything, and all possibilities were available to explore. With all the fidelity available today, I&rsquo;m happy that a lot of games are still weird. I think it&rsquo;s an aspect of video games that sets them apart, and it&rsquo;s worth celebrating once in a while. If you have any favorite weird games, or weird game moments, let me know in the comments. I am always down to talk about weird old games.&nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tSometime around the age of 4, I asked everyone to call me Starbuck. I&rsquo;m sure I demanded it. The character Starbuck from Battlestar Galactica was cool. He talked cool, flew a cool spaceship, fought cool robots and aliens with his cool friends. I wasn&rsquo;t cool. I was 4. I must have figured that if I had the cool name of a cool guy, I too would be cool. One breathtakingly hot summer day, I was running around outside, like kids do. I remember being called in for supper. I was going to head back into the house, really I was, but I figured that the best possible thing I could do at that moment was to take a full lap around the block. The block was large and my legs were short. I&rsquo;m sure that a 10 minute jaunt around the neighborhood was not what my mom, dad, grandma, or whoever had called me in, had in mind. I had already covered a few feet, so turning back would have been silly, obviously. When I was about three quarters of the way around the block, some older kids, my aunts friends, saw me and asked what I was doing. They knew who I was and knew that my given name was not what I wanted to be called. I was mid stride over some rough sidewalk when I looked over my shoulder to correct them. One quick stumble, and I went down hard. I can very clearly remember dragging myself back to my feet, holding the torn skin of my knee. I shouted back through tear filled eyes and leaking nose that my name was Starbuck. And Starbuck hobbled the rest of the way back home, with blood running down his leg, still more injured in pride than in body. I felt silly and embarrassed. I went by Owen from then on.My boys, like all children, have heroes. People other than their mom and me that they can idolize and emulate. Most of their heroes are fictional, like mine were. Several of them are youtube personalities. Adults who play cool games with their cool friends and speak in cool, practiced, presenter voices. They create entertaining videos, cut together with no small amount of skill. Several of them are actually decent role models. People who work hard at being creative. People who haven&rsquo;t waited to be offered a job, but instead created something that they seem to enjoy doing, using actual, marketable talents like storytelling, public speaking, and video production. Honestly, not terrible skills to foster and promote. As you would expect, my kids would like to do the same things they see DanTDM and Stampycat do on a near daily basis. They would like to have their own youtube channel, where they post videos that they create of themselves playing games and making stories that they enjoy. I feel that it is my responsibility to get behind anything creative that they would like to do. I have the tools available, and enough personal and professional video production experience to train them to create their own original work. If they wanted to sculpt, there would be no hesitation. We have modelling clay, wood, plastic, cardboard, and all the tools you need to shape those materials. But youtube is on the internet, and that is where I am hesitant.Once a video is on youtube, for all intents and purposes, it&rsquo;s there forever. There is a certain amount of precaution that you take when your kids play at the park. It goes without saying that, as a parent, you offer relatively vigilant supervision. You Know where they are, and how much danger you are willing to allow before you step in to protect them. They may fall. They may even hurt themselves. All part of being a kid, and I would never want to take that from them. They get scars, they heal, they get over it. The internet never forgets. The internet is designed to never forget.When I was 4, I ran around the block and fell. I have a small scar on my knee, but I don&rsquo;t remember the physical pain. That&rsquo;s gone. Erased. I do remember being embarrassed, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure no one else does. Those kids who saw me fall, they probably don&rsquo;t remember any of it. It&rsquo;s like it never happened. If a child was to stumble and fall on the internet, what part of that would be forgotten? The internet is designed to never forget. If my boys want be creative, to create videos and practice those skills, I am going to aid them in achieving that in any way that I can. But the internet is not a normal playground, and I will be very, very protective.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games &nbsp;- &nbsp;Black TigerThere was a carousel of arcade machines that rolled through the 7-Eleven just down the street from my high school. A regular noon hour activity was to head down to the &lsquo;sev&rsquo; and get in line early enough to take your shot at one of the machines. The games would get changed out every few weeks, unless it was a particularly lucrative game like Street Fighter 2 : Champion Edition. That cabinet sat in the same spot for so long, a crime scene forensics team could probably still detect its presence. Once in a while the game would be extremely popular and the lineup would would be several kids deep. The odds of getting a game in before lunch was over was really low if you were trying to play something like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and that machine could handle four players at once. Your lunch would be over, and you would have spent it standing and watching people play. Other times, a game would barely get any attention at all. Usually it was because they were garbage, like Violence Fight. I know that name sounds like a joke, but Violence Fight is a real game, and it's as awful as you would expect.Every now and then, there would be a game that gets some initial attention and then all but a few kids would leave it to play the other games on offer. It was either because the other game was some licensed unit that everyone had some prior knowledge of, like Robocop, or, In the case of Black Tiger, it was because the game was blisteringly difficult.Black Tiger, titled Black Dragon in Japan, shares some DNA with Ghosts and Goblins. Some would even say that it is a spiritual successor to the Ghosts and Goblins series, but where Ghosts and Goblins is almost unfairly difficult and can only really be beaten through luck and rote memorization, Black Tiger can be mastered through skillful play, caution, and strategic planning. A small amount of memorization helps. The crisp, pixel precise movement of the character, and the ability to level up your weapons, armour, and vitality give the player more than a fighting chance against the tremendous barrage of baddies thrown your way. Just don&rsquo;t ever get poisoned, never ever get poisoned.I&rsquo;ll be perfectly honest. Maybe Black Tiger is only a very good game and not really one of the best games of all time, but here&rsquo;s where nostalgia kicks in. During those noon hour excursions, and maybe a couple that went slightly over an hour (it was for research), I built up the ability to, at first, beat the game, and then went on to defeat it on a single quarter. I&rsquo;m sure many other people have accomplished the same feat, but I wasn&rsquo;t in high school with any of them. Sure it may be a dubious achievement, but anything you manage to get over on the other kids you went to high school with, sticks in your memory. They may not have known or cared at all about my small victory, but that hardly matters, now does it.Black Tiger, one of, at least my, best games.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\t&ldquo;Games are a journey, and should be covered like travel journalism.&rdquo; One of the finest descriptions of games writing I have ever read was that line from Heather Anne Campbell. &nbsp;She may have been paraphrasing Kieron Gillen when she wrote that games writing should be like travel journalism, but I figure she could very well have come up with this similar sentiment on her own. If her other writing is any indication, she is at least as clever as Kieron Gillen. Perhaps more clever, since she left games writing for comedy writing, and he moved on to comics writing. That&rsquo;s not a comparative judgement on the difficulty of the two. It&rsquo;s an observation on the levels of acidity of each audience.Comedy writing, where dissenters, historically, throw rotten produce at you. Comics writing, where the wounded spit through bared teeth that you have ruined their childhood. Games criticism, where the displeased threaten to murder your family.I know I&rsquo;ve said this before, but reviews are not criticism. It bears repeating. It bears being drilled with some slight degree of violence, into every person. The review is a subset of criticism. Where criticism encompases comment of any type or tone, on any topic, related to any media, considering any bias, reviews are small corner of that. Reviews are trivial and ephemeral.Criticism is more than that. Criticism is the creation of a piece of culture. Criticism is important, and when done well, elevates as often as it disassembles. Criticism of art, is art. Criticism of games, is art.We tend to view criticism as a finding of flaws. There is a caricature of the critic in public perception as failed creators, or angry zealots that exist only to tear at the good works of industrious people. This perception could not be more wrong, and is as damaging to the media being commented on as it is to those that would comment on it. Criticism is not a thing of lesser value. Thoughtful criticism is not less than the culture it comments on. It is an entirely separate piece of art, with it&rsquo;s own purpose, and it&rsquo;s own worth.I&rsquo;ve heard too many times, in too many ways, by people too smart to be so stupid, that if some critic or other doesn&rsquo;t like a thing, they should &ldquo;roll up their sleeves and create something themselves&rdquo;. They did. They did create something. They wrote or commented about something they saw. Almost certainly, they wrote about a piece of art in a medium that they love. You see, it&rsquo;s very easy to tell when a person writing about games, loves games. It&rsquo;s so subtle that you could miss it. They choose to write about games. Games writers choose to create new pieces of art that reference the medium that they love. They choose to create criticism in a medium where the displeased threaten, whether credibly or not, to murder your family. In the face of an infinite variety of tasks that a person could set themselves to, they chose games.Like any art, criticism has examples of gilded works of towering significance, protruding from vast unending fields of turds. Some criticism is terrible. Some criticism is mean and nasty and vicious for reasons only known to the creator. Some critics are barely tolerable in their condescension and willingness to ignore obvious triumphs to satisfy an audience of what I can only assume are joyless sadists. All of these critics, the thoughtful and the profane, the ones that you might think are destructive and adversarial, have one thing in common. They honestly love the medium they write about and comment on. Even though some of them revel in being unsatisfied, they all truly, at their core, want it to be better. More than want, they attempt to point the way to better. Critics are the cartographers of culture. They describe where we have been. They survey where we are, and they plot a course for where we might go. They may not always have the correct heading, they may chart a path that few agree with, but they deeply, passionately want us to become better than we are, and they are drawing a map to better in the only way that people know how. They create criticism, and that has value.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tSo I wrote a couple weeks back that I was having trouble with my Huion graphics tablet. I had threatened that I would rebuild the whole pc, reinstall windows if I had to, to get my tools working again. I made good on that threat. There is a bit of a panic feeling deep on the south end of your ribcage when you reset a computer. You start with something that you had been using, issue free, for months, with all of your tools laid out neatly on a shelf. All of a sudden this machine is asking you what time zone this is, and did you mean american english, british english, or czech, and I don&rsquo;t know if this is a monitor or speaker or a printer. You&rsquo;ve turned a workshop into a time traveling amnesiac with an obsession for self diagnosis. On the upside, everything this renewed pc will do, will be fast. Well, faster, anyway. So all the resetting, downloading, updating, and everything else will happen without the usual impediments. So, slow, but less so.Well I got that machine working again, and hours later I discovered that If I just lift the pen clear of the tablet a few inches, far enough for the tablet to lose connection with the pen, that would reset the pressure sensitivity, and the tablet would work properly again. I&rsquo;m not certain if I would have been able to just lift the pen and put it down and have the tablet work without reinstalling windows, but I know that I lifted it at least once or twice in frustration, and that didn&rsquo;t seem to fix the thing. It&rsquo;s was likely a combination of a few driver issues. I sent the bug and the solution I found to Huion, and they sent me the latest version of the driver. It doesn&rsquo;t fix the bug, but it does have a few extra features, so that&rsquo;s pretty good. All this might seem like a huge waste of time, but honestly, other than the not being able to work on the computer while it&rsquo;s being reset, I find it all pretty enjoyable. Of course, I like fixing things. Tuning them up, and making them work better than they did before. So much so, that I have also put a new ssd in the laptop and installed android on an old hp touchpad. This has been a busy week for hardware getting refreshed in this house. I have no point to get at. That is all.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThis is going to seem like some impressively pretentious nonsense. It&rsquo;s going to seem like semantic garbage. It might even be those things. I think that the way most people typically view art is wrong, and I hope this can clarify some things.We use the word &lsquo;art&rsquo; incorrectly. Through generations of linguistic evolution, we have changed a word with one definition into a word with several other, related, but different definitions. Thats not really the problem. That&rsquo;s just the way language works. It changes, and grows. That&rsquo;s what makes Chaucer barely parseable by modern english speakers. Some would suggest that this is a loss. That at some fictitious time in the past, the english language was pure, and it is being ruined by colloquialism. That argument is a real sad sort of &ldquo;get off my lawn&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s not what I mean when I say we use the word art incorrectly. Let me attempt to explain.There is a recent trend among the deviantart set, a group that tends to skew a bit younger, to use art as a verb. &ldquo;I have a deadline coming, so I&rsquo;m going to go art for a while&rdquo;&ldquo;I like your writing. Do you art too?&rdquo;&ldquo;She bought a plain white chair and arted. Now it&rsquo;s beautiful, but it will be off gassing for days.&rdquo;I&rsquo;m slightly older than the typical deviantart or tumbler denizen (if slightly means twice as old), so at first reading, of course the &ldquo;get off my lawn&rdquo; reaction was strong. Sort of like every time I hear someone say that they did something &ldquo;on accident&rdquo; a fiddle string breaks somewhere between my ears. A consequence of getting older, is that repetition codifies things like language in your brain. Hearing something that violates those perceptions can be jarring. The first reaction is usually to think that you are right and these young philistines are wrong, wrong, wrong. Who is really wrong here? You guessed it. It&rsquo;s me. Again.As much as it pains my ageing ears to hear someone verb a noun, this new usage of art is more correct. You see, art isn&rsquo;t a thing created by a person. That&rsquo;s an artifact. That&rsquo;s an object. A recording. Art is the process of a person creating something. Art is a skill. Art is taught and learned. Art is practiced, honed, maybe even mastered. Art is not something that is hung on a wall. Art is not something you watch or listen to. Art is the creation of those things. Maybe even more important, art is the creation of anything, by any person. Art is industrial container design. Art is planning bus schedules. Art is tilling land, planting seeds, and harvesting the grain. Art is creating poor puns that play off the similarities between the words arted and farted. To use the word art again, in it&rsquo;s colloquial noun form, describing the result of a person applying their skill in the creation of a thing that didn&rsquo;t previously exist, everything is art, and every person is an artist. Not everything is required to move you emotionally, and not all art is what you would call &ldquo;good&rdquo;. Some art is downright evil, or morally repugnant, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it isn&rsquo;t art. Every time I hear someone say &ldquo;I like it, but I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s art&rdquo;, I think that this is a person who needs a more full understanding of the word art. Every time I hear someone say &ldquo;I have no artistic talent&rdquo; I first think that natural talent doesn&rsquo;t exist, talent is a learned and practiced skill, and that they need a more full understanding of the word artist. Art is a verb, not a noun. As soon as you grasp that, you will see art everywhere and in everything. You will see that you are an artist.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI&rsquo;m using video games to get in better shape. Well I&rsquo;m not actually playing the games. I&rsquo;ve been watching other people play games. So far it seems to be working. I used to ride my bike to work every day. It was almost exactly 10km from my front step to the back door of the shop, on mostly paved paths. It wasn&rsquo;t a grueling ride by any measure, but it was consistent and far enough to get a sweat worked up even when it was -30c outside. One day some of the folks at the shop were going to start a weight loss competition and brought in a scale. I tested it out and was shocked to discover that I had lost about 15lbs without realizing it.I left that job to stay home with the kids, and gained back the 15 and a little extra bonus weight. A few months ago I decided that wasn&rsquo;t any good, and I missed riding my bike. I&rsquo;ve tried jogging in the past and whatever that runners high is that people talk about, apparently that isn&rsquo;t something my body chemistry can muster. I just don&rsquo;t enjoy running. Skating is probably my favorite form of exercise / method of travel, but skating is not nearly fast enough for regular commutes and snow tires for inlines have yet to be invented. Good for me then, that a close second is riding a bike. I could bike all day. There is a combination of speed and connection to the road when riding a bike that I consistently enjoy. Also, if you really set yourself to it, you can ride a bike through a foot of fresh snow and never have to deal with traffic. Just remember to allow for a little extra travel time. We have a stationary bike, which is good for getting some exercise, but really doesn&rsquo;t provide any of the things that make riding a bike fun. I tried reading while I cranked out 30 minutes on the bike, but it felt like the reading was getting in the way of the riding and vise versa. The same went for watching movies. That, and the movies were too long, and I really hate pausing a film and trying to pick it up the next day. TV shows? Maybe, but I wanted to watch something that didn&rsquo;t require a lot of focus, and I was trying to extend my workout past 30 minutes. One day, years ago I formulated a plan to dedicate a weekend to playing games. One specific game actually. Metal Gear Solid 2. The plan was to spend every hour that I wasn&rsquo;t sleeping or eating that weekend playing MGS2. Likely in my underwear. It was a good plan.When the original Metal Gear Solid came out, I didn&rsquo;t own a playstation, and really only played PC games. A friend of mine from animation school kept telling me how fantastic this game was and let me borrow his system and copy of the game to spread the gospel. I spent a week swapping back and forth between working on a portfolio project, and playing Metal Gear Solid. I would work on the animation until I needed to set up a render. Renders could take anywhere from a few minutes, to a few hours. When I queued up a long render, I would sit down to play. I finished the entire game in a few days that way, and I loved it. When Metal Gear Solid 2 came out, I still didn&rsquo;t own a console. I went out to the mall and bought a PlayStation 2 memory card, for the PS2 that I didn&rsquo;t own, as the first phase of my plan. I then went and rented the game and console from Blockbuster. It was the last one of both that the I had available. I had decided to play MGS2 until I finished it, and one marathon weekend seemed like it would be enough. I got the game and system home, set everything up and started playing. For about 2 hours. Just as I was settling in for the butt numbing, I got a call from an advertising company to do some work. Since I was working freelance at the time, and getting a call on short notice to do some work meant okay money I grudgingly returned the game and console to the blockbuster, got a partial refund, and went to work. I don&rsquo;t recall anything about that job, but I can still feel the sting of handing that PS2 back to the blockbuster clerk.Years later, I picked up a used copy of Metal Gear solid 2:Substance for the XBox. I figured this time I would be able to play through it at a reasonable pace and maybe get caught up before MGS3 came out. I played the game right up until the big shell reveal, and then a scratch in the disc halted all progress. I put the game back down. While I have followed the development of the series closely, and always intended to play one of the newer episodes, I never have. That few hours was the last time I played a Metal Gear Game. I had switched to watching Giant Bomb quick looks while I spun on the bike. They tend to be anywhere from 30-60 minutes and give me a pretty good idea if an upcoming or newly released game would appeal to me. This was working out okay, and I am able to have my arms free to lift some light weights while my legs are spinning, making even a half hour ride beneficial. Then they started playing Metal Gear Solid. A couple of the hosts, presenters, personalities, or whatever they are, at Giant Bomb started playing through Metal Gear Solid and it&rsquo;s sequels. The twist is that the guy playing had never played any of the games in the series, while his co-host has played them all. Dan, the more experienced player will share game lore, interesting facts and easter eggs, while trying not to offer any explicit help. Drew, the guy playing will make mistakes, fumble encounters, but eventually work through the challenges of the game, much like any first time player would. It&rsquo;s like getting to experience these games they way I would have years ago while watching an entertaining examination of the series. All while riding the bike and lifting weights. My workout time regularly goes past 45 minutes and I&rsquo;ve hit the hour mark more than once. I haven&rsquo;t lost 15 lbs yet, but I&rsquo;m pretty steadily dropping weight. Better than that though I&rsquo;ve lowered my percentage of body fat a good amount. In stark contrast to my old plan of sitting motionless in my own filth to play these games, I&rsquo;m really enjoying them while burning some calories. With dozens of hours of Metal Gear games left to go, watching other people play games might just make me healthier. Thanks Metal Gear.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tSo, I&rsquo;ve been trying to get my Huion graphics tablet to work properly on my main PC for a couple of days now. It works fine on the laptop, and presumably, would work properly on any other computer I hooked it up to. The pen tracks without glitches or stutters, but there is no pressure sensitivity. What is more baffling is that I had been using it only a few days ago, and it was working normally. While I have been able to determine that this is not a hardware problem, I still haven&rsquo;t been able to resolve the issue. What probably happened is that a windows update of microsofts own tablet drivers have done something to severely bork the drivers for this particular tablet. Sleuthing out what files to delete and what components to uninstall and reinstall to correct the issue has proved difficult.I know I&rsquo;ve said it here before, but I&rsquo;m the type of person who has an abnormally high tolerance for this sort of digital nonsense. I won&rsquo;t hesitate to enter the command line or dig around in the windows registry to fix a problem. Reinstalling windows is a bit of a pain, but not out of the question. I made this PC, and if need be, I&rsquo;ll break it to get it working the way I want. I realize this isn&rsquo;t the attitude of most computer users, and even fewer artists. As a function of the work, artist tend to know their tools better than a lot of professions. When the core of your job is the subtle manipulation of a brush, knife, or guitar, you become very familiar with the edges of those tools. The things that they are capable of, and how you can manipulate them to be more than they appear. A computer is a magnificent tool, a tool that can change and shift from one task to the next. It&rsquo;s the anything machine. It&rsquo;s also a black box, where much of what it does is not understood by the person manipulating it. There is not one person alive who understands every feature and part of the Windows operating system. The same is true of the Mac OS and Linux. Maybe, at one time, there were a handful of engineers and designers that could tear down, clean out, and reassemble a computer at it&rsquo;s base level. Now it takes legions, and still problems slip through the cracks. Countless artist use computers to speed up traditional methods of working, and create things that would be impossible without the use of a computer. They do so knowing that they have to give up a small amount of control. Mastery of the tool will never be absolute. I can build my own brushes from birch sticks and hair. I can&rsquo;t use a computer without leaning on millions of hours of other peoples work. I can fix broken tools, but I can only fix a computer by venturing past the realm of my training. To be clear, I don&rsquo;t think that this is inherently good or bad. Just different. Different to what centuries of artists had been use to. But I do think that the effort to make tools &ldquo;that just work&rdquo; is a dangerous one. Because they won&rsquo;t. They won&rsquo;t just work. They will break, like tools do, like tools always have. An effort should be made instead, to teach us how to fix them, or failing that, who to ask for help in the repairs. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThat&rsquo;s good game design!I was sitting on the edge of the bed staring at the widely spread phosphors of a cheap 20 inch color TV. My friend had recently moved his bedroom from the the highest point in his parents aging, but immaculate farm house, to the cool dry of the basement. It&rsquo;s the move all teenage boys are eager to make. The yearning for the cave lifestyle must be deep in our cellular makeup. He could have stopped there and I would have still thought this new abode lined with Iron Maiden and ACDC emblems, was comfortably epic. He went one further, and picked up an old TV from a relative and bought a brand new SEGA Genesis. I still wasn&rsquo;t fully convinced that a game console was a thing you could own. We would regularly rent a console and a stack of games from the video store for weekends at a time. It would get hooked up and we would spend as many hours as humanly possible trying to play through the games. The notion that a current generation game machine could be set up in your own room every weekend! Absurd! I mean how would that even work. I was staring at the mass of blue pixels, Sonic impatiently tapping his foot waiting for the player to get on with playing already. And I said &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good game design!&rdquo; I had next to no idea what game design was, what was required to tune a jump so that it had just enough float, just enough gravity. I didn&rsquo;t understand what it took to balance rules and movement speeds. I just saw a hedgehog standing there tapping his foot and I equated that with good design. I still think that I was right. Design is entirely about details. The ones you include, the ones you cut. The reason you keep the details that you do. How those details fit into the whole. You could pick up any three games from the same era as Sonic, and at least one of the other two would be about jumping. The minor differences between those jumping games, platformers is the accepted term, were all that set them apart. They all contained elements of running and jumping, they all had enemies that you could either jump on or attack to dispatch, and they all had platforms floating in space, self suspended by magical programming fairy dust. The only differentiators they had going for them were the minor details. Small adjustments in attitude and style. Sonic, the character, knows how you should be playing his game. When you wait around he is unhappy and impatient. When you push him forward, he flies, he swoops, he soars. For a game to suggest the most fun way to play it, not demand, not enforce, just suggest. That is good game design.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tLast year my sons said that they wanted to go as zombies for halloween, but not the regular raggy clothes and dark makeup around the eyes type zombies, Minecraft zombies. Minecraft zombies are nondescript, brown and green boxes with arms and legs. A full body costume consisting mostly of unbendable boxes that I knew they would find to uncomfortable to wear wasn&rsquo;t going to happen. I managed to talk them down to a set of diamond Minecraft armor. I didn&rsquo;t know exactly how I was going to accomplish that. Cardboard boxes, cloth attached to a dowel structure. Cardboard would never hold up to how my kids were going to abuse these costumes. I know how to sew, but not competently enough for nice looking costumes. I eventually opted for foam mats and this was the result.         Recently they game of choice around here is Terraria, so when we asked what they wanted to be for halloween, the answer wasn&rsquo;t very surprising. They both have different opinions on what they coolest looking terraria armor is, so I knew I would have at least two challenges to tackle.&nbsp;That&rsquo;s the thing. If you ask me to build something, and I am pretty sure I can do it, but I don&rsquo;t really know how yet, i&rsquo;m hooked. I could have taken them to the store and bought a costume, or put one together out of the stuff we had kicking around, but I was presented with the opportunity to build something new, and I couldn&rsquo;t resist.&nbsp;Since I wasn&rsquo;t planning ahead, I never took any pictures of the process, but this is the short breakdown of how I built this years halloween costumes.   \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t          \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t          \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t \t   I started out with the art from the game as reference. I made a swipe at the pixilated blocky look last year and I found that pixilated stuff just doesn&rsquo;t easily translate into real world items. I did a few rough sketches of what those sprites could represent, if they really existed and were scaled up to kid size.&nbsp;I found working with EVA foam incredibly easy last time so this time I went and found a giant 4&rsquo;x6&rsquo; rolled up shop mat. The foam was a bit thinner than your standard foam tile mats, but that just made bending the foam around curves easier. Once I was a small way into the process I did some searching around on the internet for costuming tutorials. As it turned out, this sort of foam is what people use to make costumes all the time. Not knowing this before I jumped in made me feel equal parts clever and dumb. But I&rsquo;m sort of used to that.I hand drew some paper patterns so I could trace them down onto the foam, and then just started cutting. I used either a utility knife or scissors for all the cutting. I assembled the pieces as I went, cutting, adjusting, and adding detail as needed. All the assembly was done with hot glue and some elastic strap I got at the dollar store.         Since these were supposed to look like armor I didn&rsquo;t bother with coating the foam with anything before painting, and just let the original dark grey stand as the base color. The painting was all acrylic and sparkly poster paint we had here. I used a sponge, and some cheap brushes to do all the painting, going over some areas with a dry brush to even out the details, and hide my mistakes.&nbsp;         In the end, they turned out okay, and they should stand up to most of the nerf and lightsaber battles that go on here throughout the rest of the year.Of course this also means that I went and raised the expectation bar one notch, and next year when they want to wear a full working ironman suit with firing missiles and LED eyes, I&rsquo;ll probably consider it briefly before steering them toward Hawkeye or Madripoor Wolverine. I know that I do it to myself, but I would be lying if I said it isn&rsquo;t fun.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI just finished reading Game Over, a book by David Sheff that came out in 1993. I was reading it because I wanted to read a new book that came out this year, Console Wars, by Blake Harris. I had read or heard that the first makes a good companion piece for the second. While I can now agree that, yes, these two books do form a consistent timeline from the formation of Nintendo 125 years ago, up through the 16 bit era in the mid-90s, I don&rsquo;t know if that is the way I would recommend anyone else read them. I just happen to have a deep seated interest in both history and video games, so these are books that appeal to my particular tastes. Either one is interesting on it&rsquo;s own and Console Wars is a bit funnier, and does give you a nice catch up chapter to fill you in on any history you may have missed.While I enjoyed Game Over and I am currently enjoying Console Wars, I hadn&rsquo;t planned to write a book report here. I was thinking, instead, about something that comes up time and again in both books. A theme that comes up time and again in a lot of histories actually. Let me start with an example. Every company with computer hardware or a game console has tried to create either a download service or a full blown network. There was a cartridge made for the Atari 2600 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameLine that would allow you to download and play games, read news, get stock info etc. There is a scattered wasteland of such products all the way up and into the 16 bit console era. Despite Modems being a well understood technology at the time not one company could create a network service that people actually wanted to buy into. Not even Nintendo, who had hardware in millions of homes around the world, could entice people to connect the things to a phone or cable line. TCP, on the other hand, is created as a standard protocol that would enable almost any digital device to talk to any other device. No company backs it, no entity aims to control it, and after a few years of kicking around labs and research projects, a simple open standard allows for explosive growth in computer networking. TCP/IP allows for the creation of the internet and any of the tech companies that survived the early years benefit in unprecedented ways. New companies and technologies spring up to feed off of and feed into the internet. In a matter of a decade, the world is changed.It&rsquo;s not just a matter of the right thing at the right time. Those early stabs at creating networks where not so technologically inferior to TCP that they couldn&rsquo;t have rose up to become the internet. The copper wires that carried the signal from one point to another back then are the same ones that carry our phone, television, and internet today. The switches that connect them are faster, smaller, cheaper now than they were then, but the job they do is the same. So why didn&rsquo;t these networks take off?People are terrible at predicting the future, especially when they attempt to mold those predictions into long term realities. Conversely, people are phenomenal at exploiting innovation. The early attempts at networks would have benefited only the company that designed and implemented the network. It was a closed loop, a black box. The ability to exploit that particular innovation was limited to the &nbsp;few people at that one company that understood it. The impulse to build monopoly into an innovation doomed it from the start. No one wants to play in your sandbox when you set the rules. Turns out there is a lot more sand available, enough for many sandboxes.&ldquo;They will buy it, because we will sell it to them&rdquo; echos in the hollowed out husks of many once powerful companies. Not just companies, civilizations. And the innovations that allowed many to benefit, the ideas that could be the most fully exploited in the most wildly different ways, persist. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s luck. It may be difficult to plan for success, but planning for failure appears to be as easy as taking an imperialistic stance on innovation.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWhile doing some research for a presentation I may get to delivering, one day, in the far off future, I got to thinking about Truespace. I don&#8217;t fault you if you&#8217;ve never heard of it. In the history of computer 3D modelling and animation, Truespace barely registers as a footnote. I had fiddled with Povray, and some 3D features of Autocad, but Truespace was the first 3D animation program I ever used. The reason I stuck with it, and actually learned how to use the tools in Truespace can be boiled down to one word. Feedback.If you look at the Truespace (Truespace2 to be exact) interface now, it looks archaic and maybe even a little childish. Even so, it is as friendly and easily parsed as when I fired it up around 1996. When you compare it to the abusive interface of Autocad from the same time, Truespace was probably a full decade ahead of the curve. It all boils down to feedback. If you wanted to move a model around on a flat plane, you would click the translate button, or press the associated hotkey and move your mouse. The model would move. Select rotation and move your mouse, the object would rotate. You could define the axis of motion, rotation, or scale, based on what mouse buttons you clicked and where your hand moved. By this point you are probably wondering what the big deal is. Moving the mouse to move an object on screen is pretty much the way programs work, right? 3D graphics at the time were still barely crawling out of the text editor. The only systems that operated like I just described would cost several thousand dollars and only run on some high end proprietary hardware. Even then, programs like autocad and 3d studio, that may actually be available to the average human, were complex beyond reason. More often than not most programs would have you consider the problem, type in the values that solve the problem, and then redraw the scene to see if your changes worked. In Truespace you would click and drag. Instant Feedback.Truespace was certainly less capable than other 3d animation software of the time, and it was quickly overshadowed by the likes of Lightwave and 3Dstudio Max, but it gave me enough of a head start that I was able to get very comfortable with more advanced software when the opportunity presented itself. Software that provides constant, consistent feedback has always been easier for me to learn. Even when things get very arcane, like the dependency graph in Maya, if the program offers constant feedback (maya is a feedback factory) learning will come easily. Funny enough, that&#8217;s how just about all games work. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI&rsquo;m fairly certain an artist should not be the sole judge of their own work. Maybe a case can be made for the auteurs of the world having the final say on how their work gets presented. I think that is likely rubbish, and any creator given total control and freedom will either make something terrible, or just never finish anything at all. I&rsquo;ve been working on the same set of shaders for ages now, and while I can tell how the new version is subtly better than all the previous versions, it&rsquo;s doubtful that anyone else will notice, or care. I could probably put a few years into tuning an effect or model or bit of animation, and never be fully satisfied. It&rsquo;s a cliche that the artist is always the harshest critic, but I don&rsquo;t think that is really true. It&rsquo;s not that I think the things I make are terrible, it&rsquo;s that I know how much work it will take to improve them. I use to work in commercial art. Logos, layouts, designs, compositions, that sort of thing. Often I would work very hard at it, really put some solid thought and effort into making the best whatever I was making. Some of the stuff, I was really proud of. Sure I saw the flaws, the places that a bit more time, money, or material could have improved, but I wasn&rsquo;t upset about it. I felt like I had done a good job for the client and I was happy to present them with whatever it was they were paying me for. They were happy, I was happy, I could move on to the next job and do it all over again. This cycle played itself out almost daily. It certainly didn&rsquo;t drag on for months.So there is the problem, and also the solution. It isn&rsquo;t that artists are too critical of their own work to ever be satisfied. The problem is that the client can&rsquo;t be yourself. The time will never come when you won&rsquo;t send something back to yourself for revision. You will never hesitate to offer yourself notes. And on the other side, you won&rsquo;t take the extra step to please yourself. You won&rsquo;t put in overtime trying to meet your own standards. You already know that you are the worst kind of client. One that can never give a final sign off, one that can&rsquo;t resist asking for one more pass. So the solution I&rsquo;m working on is to not be the client. It might not be entirely healthy for a grown man to invent imaginary people. I&rsquo;ve got a client here with me, we&rsquo;ll call him Jeff. Maybe it&rsquo;s Geof. Either way, that guy is giving me the big thumbs up on this latest version of the shader. He tells me he has a bunch of orders to put through. 3D models, UI, animations, a whole stack of stuff he needs for this game. I couldn&rsquo;t be happier to help. I want this project of his to look great and I&rsquo;ll keep banging away on these orders. I may still see the flaws and the places where things could be improved, but Geof over here, he has pretty high standards and he says it&rsquo;s looking good. If he&rsquo;s happy, I&rsquo;m happy. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - BattlezoneIt&rsquo;s the late 1960s. Saturn, Titan, Vostok, and Proton rockets have been launching from both sides of the cold war. The official word is that they have been carrying probes, satellites, astronauts, and cosmonauts. These are science focused spacecraft. The mission is exploration and the betterment of mankind. lies.The premise of the 1998 remake of the classic 1980 vector tank game Battlezone is schlocky scifi alternate history at it&rsquo;s best. It posits that the space race was a cover for a covert war fought across the solar system for an alien metal called scrap.Scrap has the ability to self assemble into all manner of space tank, space factory, space turret, and other space stuff. All you need to do is send out mobile resource collecting vacuums to suck it up in quantities sufficient enough to build new things. The game is played primarily from a first person perspective, either on foot, or from the inside of a space tank. It would be easy to mistake Battlezone for a first person shooter, but it is a strategy game at its core. You manage your bases, defenses, and troops from on the ground. Issuing orders, building units, and setting waypoints is all handled from inside your tank. What struck me immediately, was that there was no grid system, no suggested locations for any of the more mobile units. The strategy section of this action/strategy game is about as freeform as they could make it. I would regularly use moon craters and martian canyons as environmental cover, drawing enemies into a prearranged crossfire. Being flexible and using the terrain to your advantage is the key to victory in Battlezone. The usual point of view for a real time strategy game is from high overhead allowing the player to command and organize their troops board game style. Since Battlezone is played almost entirely from the point of view of a unit on the ground the way you issue orders to your units is unique, and seriously hasn&rsquo;t been improved upon in the last 16 years. Battlezone uses an incredibly elegant hierarchical menu system that you operate with the number keys. You get shockingly fast at wrangling your troops using this system, and what small amount of micromanaging that you lose by not having a birds eye view, you can make up for with your own tanks combat abilities and movement speed.Just driving the hovering space tanks around is a pure joy, which is good because driving around is what you spend most of your time doing in Battlezone. You drive over here to tell this unit to follow you, then you drive over there to tell another unit to hold a position. You drive over to one of your other units to order the pilot to switch space tanks with you so you can drive out with a faster, smaller tank. You park that smaller tank in a crater so that it&rsquo;s hidden when you jump out on foot to go spy on the enemy operations from a high cliff. Then you use your sniper rifle to take out a few enemy pilots while you&rsquo;re up there. You jump down and hop in one of their newly driverless space tanks, and you drive that back to your base. Battlezone is space tank driving, strategy thinking fun. There has never been another game quite like it, and it did things that have yet to be improved upon. It&rsquo;s one of the best games. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWe just returned from a trip to Disney World. I could go on and on about how impressive I found nearly every aspect of the park. How the garbage cans are uniquely designed to be both ever present and completely invisible. How lines for rides are finely tuned psychological tricks that can make you feel like you haven&rsquo;t waited very long at all, while still keeping you thoroughly corralled and out of the way of passing traffic. People at Disney have put an enormous amount of work into making the actual functioning machinery of the park disappear. That is probably why I found the fictional game created for Wreck It Ralph so impressive.         The Fix It Felix Jr. arcade machine was created to disappear. You would think that the first impulse of a gargantuan entertainment company would be to pull your focus to whatever peripheral merchandise they had on offer. This game could have been a massive movie tie in, put out on every game system available, and sold by the hundreds to collectors as stand up cabinets for home arcades. Instead, you can download the executable for the game for free to run on any home pc. It&rsquo;s really quite a good game too.The arcade machine appears to be a gutted and repurposed Nintendo cabinet for Donkey Kong or Donkey Kong Jr. The control panel and screen bezel artwork certainly apes the Donkey Kong cabinet in some really shameless ways. If I had to hazard a guess, I would say that they art direction for Fix It Felix Jr. was to imagine an alternate world where Donkey Kong was never created and Fix it Felix was in fact the first Shigeru Miyamoto game. Fix It Felix Jr was the follow up sequel released in 1982. If you tuck this cabinet into a row of other classic games from the early to mid 80s, as they did in the one arcade we went to, it blends in so thoroughly that It would be difficult for someone who didn&rsquo;t know to tell that it is only a year or two old. This historical camouflage covered every aspect of the machine. Different part of the decals had been faded in different ways. The crt monitors used as the games displays were in various states of phosphor degradation, so the color reproduction on one machine was completely different from it&rsquo;s neighbors. Scrapes on the sides of the case were in straight lines at different heights, hinting that at some point in the past 30 fictional years another shorter cabinet had rubbed against it in transport. There were different spring tensions in the sticks suggesting that one cabinet had seen more abuse than the others. One of the machines even had a cigarette burn in the acrylic control surface. I don&rsquo;t know if I have ever seen a fictional artifact so fully realized. It&rsquo;s especially impressive considering that the target audience for the movie would not have been born when this game was supposed to have come out. There is a very real chance that kids could walk into that arcade and think that Wreck it Ralph was based on an actual game that came out in 1982. Whoever you are who made these things, you have my applause. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tMy house has moved on. We were a Minecraft house. Minecraft for breakfast, Minecraft to tuck you in at night, Minecraft in your dreams. On the time scale of a 7 year old, we stopped playing that decades ago. In reality it has been weeks. The obsession with Minecraft has been superseded by Terraria. To the uninitiated both games seem fairly similar. Both are sandbox style toys that allow the player to change the world as they see fit. They can tear down the world as it is, and recreate it to suit them. The player can use resources extracted from the world to create new, more powerful items, which can be used to extract more valuable resources, and build more spectacular items. So it&rsquo;s a lot like real life. Even though they are much the same mechanically, I think the draw of Terraria over Minecraft is the constant progression. Where most of the world is available to you from the outset in Minecraft, Terraria must be tackled in stages. You can&rsquo;t craft this item or enter that area, until you defeat this boss, or complete that quest. There is a gated progression. There is narrative. This then that. You have to play Minecraft to play Minecraft. Any time that you are not playing the game, you could imagine the things that you would like to build, but without the tools there, in front of you, you can&rsquo;t really do anything concrete. There are very few goals, besides the ones that the players impose on the game. Terraria on the other hand, can be played while away from the computer. There are plans to be laid, strategies to consider. You can approach each boss battle or world event in dozens of different ways. You can compare the relative strengths of stacks of armour, weapons, tools, and equipment, choosing the ones that best suit your play style. Each puzzle or enemy that you best will spawn new possible challenges. In Minecraft you construct a world, in Terraria you construct a story. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThere are some very hostile and ugly things going on in some dark corners of video gaming. You can read about it here if you like, http://www.vox.com/2014/9/6/6111065/gamergate-explained-everybody-fighting .If you read a lot of media focused on the industry it may seem as though there is a full scale assault on indie developers, studio developers, journalists, bloggers, critics, reviewers, and on and on. There is not. The overwhelming majority of people who play games, make games, buy games, sell games, probably have no clue that anything of note is going on. They don&rsquo;t know or care that a small group of angry, distasteful people have been organising to attack and harass specific developers and writers. They don&rsquo;t know that these same people spawned and bolstered multiple, apparently pro-consumer, activist movements as a smokescreen to distance themselves from borderline illegal, and actually illegal, activity. There is no reason for most people to know any of this, because it doesn&rsquo;t affect them. It doesn&rsquo;t affect me. Not really. Not immediately. Not in a, fear for my career or life, sort of way. Not in the way that it does Zoe Quinn, Anita Sarkeesian, Jenn Frank, or a long list of other devs, writers, or critics. A list composed primarily of women. Women who make, play, and love games. I lied before. It does affect me, if you play games, it affects you. It affects the entire medium, top to bottom. &nbsp;Games are a cultural byproduct. We make them just by being human, by playing, by being a mammalian apex predator with some free time to think about our place in the universe. Games come from the same place as music, theatre, poetry. We have always, and will always make games.For any medium, a broad range of voices, from a broad range of experiences, elevates. Creating an environment so toxic that some people don&rsquo;t and can&rsquo;t feel safe speaking their experience, sharing their stories and games, will doom &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; to a cultural backwater. For people like me, who have played and loved games their entire lives, and have grasped for any sign of cultural legitimacy for the form, it is heart wrenching to watch. To see a writer the caliber of Jenn Frank silenced by a hateful few made me feel hollow, angry, powerless. When hers was a voice that we could point to and say, there. look, she knows why games are important, and she explains it so much better than we ever could.Film didn&rsquo;t end with Birth of a Nation. I don&rsquo;t think this is the end of games. I don&rsquo;t think that this medium of expression will be denied cultural legitimacy. In fact, I think the tide has already turned. Those of us that grew up with video games respect them alongside music and novels and paintings and sculpture, as a cultural artifact. An important facet of our collective identity. My worry isn&rsquo;t for us. If young girls coming out of high school don&rsquo;t feel safe sharing their voice through games, we will all be poorer for it. If people from the LGBT community don&rsquo;t feel that games can tell their stories, share their experiences, due to the potential for threats, and hate, they will express themselves through other media, and games will be poorer for it. The ethics, and gamer culture that these movements purport to protect will be broken. The voices silenced will take a generation to replace. It is very lucky for us then that teenage girls and marginalized people can be relied upon to regularly throw up a middle finger to oppression. And lets be perfectly, crystal clear here, oppression is what is going on. This isn&rsquo;t about journalistic integrity or corruption. Any claim made that attempts to house games media and journalistic integrity in the same sentence, is either by someone terribly naive or someone who doesn&rsquo;t understand the meaning of those words. And I&rsquo;m not suggesting that this is a considered, crafted oppression. This isn&rsquo;t a pogrom on uppity female developers. This is the more insidious kind. The sort of oppression that is feverishly rallied around by disenfranchised 16 year olds, afraid that one of the few things that they have in life to hang an identity on might be slipping away from them. That the video games, skate parks, metal bands, or other scenes, might be fading away. Or worse yet, you might be outgrowing the scene and are clawing back at it as hard as you possibly can. I like to think that I would have been too introspective or empathetic to engage in this sort of activity, but it&rsquo;s the sort of oppression I could have seen my 16 year old self attempting to justify. And I would have been wrong. Terribly, horribly, unforgivably wrong. If you read any of the #gamergate commentary, and think, well maybe they have a point, I would like you to remember these three rules for dealing with any commercial industry.The customer is not always right. You can speak, but you do not have a right to be heard. Not all points of view are valid. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI steal from the past.There are literally thousands of games floating around out there. Games, books, limericks, bathroom graffiti, and the stunning industrial design of cotton swabs are all created by people influenced by previous works. You could go ahead and act like a turd heap by saying that your ideas are wholly original. Somehow, among the great miasma of human output, you managed it. You did something that no one else had ever considered. Just reach back there and give yourself the old patty pat. Never happened. Not once.This might sound like one of those &ldquo;its all been done. shut it down&rdquo; screeds. It&rsquo;s not. It hasn&rsquo;t all been done. Not even remotely. New ways of doing things, new objects, new concepts, are generated at a rate that would stagger the Flash. Not The Flash back when Wally West couldn&rsquo;t vibrate through objects and stuff. The old Barry Allen Flash where he would regularly outrun laser beams. All of this new jazz being created is built from the crust of what came before.Games are entertainment, and since almost all entertainment is driven by novelty, it is easy to convince yourself that a game concept or mechanic is &ldquo;new&rdquo;. That mechanic is probably borrowed from some obscure and unsuccessful game. Even more likely, it came from some other mundane task completely unrelated to games like washing dishes or folding laundry. Me, I like to steal. I comb through literally thousands of old games to find fun mechanics that I can appropriate. I don&rsquo;t find the idea of remaking an old game interesting, so that isn&rsquo;t really my aim. I try to find things that I enjoy in a game, and then see how that mechanic can be used elsewhere. Hopefully to better effect. As an example, do you remember Paperboy. Everyone loved that game, even though the control was awful, you often couldn&rsquo;t tell what was a hazard and what wasn&rsquo;t, and navigating the later levels had to be done in some sort of yogic trance that would allow you to see the future. There was one incredibly fun part though. Throwing the papers forced you to estimate your speed and lead your target. You could aim for the mailboxes and front porches of your customers, or you could choose to use your very limited resource of rolled projectiles to bust windows, take out villains, and break up fights. Every time you throw a paper in Paperboy, it&rsquo;s fun. That is a mechanic that is in desperate need of stealing, If only so that it won&rsquo;t be tied to the rest of that mess of a game. There are at least hundreds of underused game ideas floating around, often in popular, or once popular games. Not stealing them and building better games around them would be&hellip; wasteful. Admit it, you thought I was going to write criminal there didn&rsquo;t you. didn&rsquo;t you. yeah you did. Everyone steals their ideas. I just want to be honest about it. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThis weekend I took part in Ludum Dare 30. Ludum Dare is a game jam that takes place over a weekend, either 48 or 72 hours, depending on how you want to participate. You can develop a game alone or in a group, choose to compete or not. Really it&rsquo;s just a good excuse for game developers, and aspiring game developers, to take a break from whatever they are currently working on and intensely focus on creating something brand new for one weekend. It&rsquo;s the game developer equivalent of dealing with writers block. I have worked in teams for the last few global game jams, and I thought it would be an interesting challenge to attempt Ludum Dare alone. Fairly early on I knew that I probably wouldn&rsquo;t submit a game for the community judged competition. I was there for the exercise of breaking down a game design problem in rapid fashion, just to see what I could come up with. If the plan had been to build a full game, get it working and submitting it (my typical plan for Global Gamejam) then I failed. But failing is okay. In fact failing is great. Game jams force you to fail early and often. Get used to it, and get over it. I like to scour my game jam submissions for any successful ideas that can be hammered into potentially marketable projects. Since that is my real goal, this Ludum Dare was actually incredibly successful.The competition deadline was 7:00pm on sunday. As you would suspect, I came up with a unifying theme, streamlined game mechanic, and the base parts for what could become a commercial product, at around 9:30pm on sunday. I gave it a night to simmer. If it still seemed like a good idea in the morning, I figured I would be stupid not to pursue it. So, now I have a few pages of notes for two games that I want to work on, and still finish the art for Adventure Caddie. Schools coming, so I will be &ldquo;full time&rdquo; soon, or as I think I will call it &ldquo;The Owen works by himself on existing game projects Jam&rdquo;. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tIf you have read any of these posts before, you know that I have a serious love/hate relationship with Blender. For all it&rsquo;s advances and additions over the years Blender still remains one of the more inscrutable tools I have ever used. That list includes the gloriously impenetrable ZBrush and some proprietary sign manufacturing software designed by moderately intelligent squirrels. I have used Blender to rig characters before, but had you interrogated me afterward, I would have conceded that I may have been aided by wizards. Mind you, I&rsquo;m not new to character rigging. I have written code for custom rigs in Maya and Max, so even at a base level, character rigging is a concept I&rsquo;m familiar with. This week I participated in a series of cage match battles with the Blender rigging system. I&rsquo;ll be honest, I wasn&rsquo;t sure which of us would exit the cage. I eyeballed the Maya LT license page, aka &ldquo;the tapout&rdquo; more than once. Going the Maya route would be more comfortable, possibly faster, but it would also cost more money than none, which is what I currently pay for Blender. At every roadblock I had to ask myself if learning the obtuse way that one or two programmers thought these tools should work was worth the effort. It&rsquo;s like a professional level adventure game puzzle. I expect that Blenders Inverse Kinematics solvers will incorporate a rubber chicken and some chewed gum at some point. This weeklong fight allowed me to pinpoint my problems with Blender. It turns out they are very much the same as the problems that I have with Apple products. The same &ldquo;simplicity&rdquo; that most people enjoy typically means that anything under the hood is obscured from the user. When I search around for an explanation of different tools in Blender, I find a lot of people saying feature X works this way &ldquo;just because&rdquo; Unfortunately for me, I have the sort of brain that is not, and will never be, happy with &ldquo;just because&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s probably why both Maya and Unity clicked for me. Both of those programs bombard the user with information about what is going on in front of them and just say &ldquo;here, deal with it&rdquo;. They try to put the velocity of the information hose under the users control, but the feedback loop of your actions resulting in visible, recorded changes, is tight enough to tell brains like mine &ldquo;here&rsquo;s why&rdquo;. I can learn systems like Blender too, but it might take me a week.That said, I still remain positive about the future of Blender. There seems to be a serious interest in making most features nodal, which would would improve usability and visibility of buried features. An actual viewer for the dependency graph would also be incredibly useful. These features would go a long way in breaking the hobbyist stigma that still clings to Blender, despite it having all the features of most of the pro 3D programs. Right now Blender is in a race though, whether they know it or not. If Maya comes out with a much cheaper or even free option, before they can get their act together, the race will be lost.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThe procedural future is coming. There have always been video games with procedurally generated elements. That is, parts of the videogames you play are created on the fly, usually following some predetermined set of rules. These elements aren&rsquo;t meticulously constructed by an artist or designer. They are built by the computer, following a blueprint or set of rules laid out by the game designer. Sometimes the blueprint is explicit, recreating the exact same assets every time the game is run. Other times there is a random, or pseudo-random element to how that part of the game is created. Games use procedural generation for level design, enemy AI, sounds, music, graphic details, even game mechanics. Early PCs barely had enough memory and storage space to hold this blog post, let alone the massive requirements of an interactive experience, so a lot of games used procedural generation to simply function at all under extremely tight hardware constraints. Game worlds would be created following this blueprint laid out by the designer every time the player loaded into a new area or level. Storing the blueprint rather than every single detail that goes into creating a game level, allowed developers to shoehorn massive fantasy and sci-fi worlds onto floppy disks. As hard drive space and system memory grew, the ability to discreetly author most elements of a game meant grander, more cinematic, and more precisely written games could be created. Entire worlds created procedurally fell out of vogue for a while.Here&rsquo;s the thing. Computers never complain about how much work they have to do, you never have to pay a computer overtime, and a computer never suffers repetitive stress injuries. Of course computers are also absolutely bunk at being creative. Procedural creation of assets tends to create a lot of very samey looking junk. Or at least it used to. In the early days of computer games, developers were forced to use procedural generation techniques by the bottleneck of insufficient storage and memory. Present day game development has hit a new, more difficult, bottleneck. Creating the sprawling vastness and detail of something like the assassins creed games requires an enormous amount of artistic manpower. That costs way too much money to be sustainable. Paying enough people to recreate a realistic city in a reasonable amount of time is just not going to be feasible if the fidelity of the images keeps increasing. At some point these games no longer contain elaborately decorated facades, but actual meticulously constructed cities, populated with digital citizens.Of course the solution is not to say that we&rsquo;ve topped out. The argument that games will just never look any better, or be any more sprawling than they are now is just flat out delusional. The real answer is to go back to procedural generation on a massive scale. Create better, more dynamic blueprints for procedural systems to churn away on. The real artistry of future games will not be perfectly creating single beautiful trees, but taking the trees that the world provides and strategically pruning them into a beautiful form. Cities and levels won&rsquo;t be designed, they will be grown and tailored to the create fun places to play. What might be most surprising, is that creating virtual worlds, will be not unlike building things in the real world. The starting point won&rsquo;t be a blank screen, but a rich landscape, created through random interactions of detailed simulations. It may seem like I&rsquo;m overselling the future here. This is the same sort of nonsense that people were spouting in the early 90s when the VR fad was in full swing. The difference here is that massive procedurally generated environments already exist in some very financially successful games and simulations. In games, like in everything, strategies that make money get used again, and developed further. The promise of an engaging game world without end makes a lot of money it, turns out. Ask the developers of Minecraft and Star Citizen. I was going to write a whole thing about how architecture is the original balance between procedural generation and authored content, but maybe I&rsquo;ll leave that for another post. This one is already long and boring enough.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tYou never want to be &ldquo;that guy&rdquo;. I know I have been &ldquo;that guy&rdquo;. I narrowly avoided being &ldquo;that guy&rdquo; a couple of days ago. My family went out to see Guardians of the Galaxy over the weekend. Super fun movie, by the way, but that&rsquo;s not really what I&rsquo;m writing about&hellip; but yeah, go see it, like really, go see it. Anyway, we went out, saw the movie, everyone had fun. As we were leaving the theater there were two guys talking excitedly just ahead of us. They had obviously enjoyed what they had just watched and were eager to go over the finer points of Marvel movies, Infinity Guantletry in particular. How do I describe these guys? Here, I&rsquo;ll attempt to paint you a word picture. Let me just say here that these guys looked as though they had probably seen the inside of a comic shop on more than one occasion. I would suspect deck building games occupied a fair bit of their time. I gathered from their appearance and, unfortunately odor, that they had darkened the door of a Games Workshop or two. They were geeks okay. They were the kind of guys that you would expect to be fascinated by the minutia of genre films and comic lore. They were talking happily and excitedly. They were talking about movies and comics, and the reconstruction of a story told many years ago. They were bringing up obscure artifacts from modern day myths. Stories of warring gods and titans. Primal forces from the before the universe began. And they were wrong. They said that there were 5 infinity gems (there are 6). They had mixed up the space and reality gems and called the Aether&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know what, but something wrong. And finally, they forgot the mind gem, everyone seems to forget about the mind gem. But do you know what they real kicker is, do you want to know what they really got wrong. Nothing. They did absolutely nothing wrong. These guys were just a couple of buddies who went out to enjoy a film together. After the movie was over, they were excited and wanted the fun to keep going, so they got to talking about all the fun things from the movie that they thought were fun when they read them in comics, that were also fun. And here comes me, being &ldquo;that guy&rdquo; to tell them that they are enjoying their fun wrong. Well that&rsquo;s some B.S. Why should I tell someone that their enjoyment of these fictional stories isn&rsquo;t on par with how a real fan enjoys them. Who am I to decree if they are having fun in the correct way.It&rsquo;s not just that I&rsquo;m a butt munch either. This feeling that people need to enjoy things in some sort of codified way is pervasive through all the geeky pursuits. Sci fi, fantasy, horror, board games, video games, card games, all of them have their self appointed defenders ready to piss down from on high all over anyone not as deeply invested as themselves. It keeps people out. It makes something fun, uninviting to newcomers, and can even drive away people with a passing interest. I didn&rsquo;t want to be &ldquo;that guy&rdquo;, so I didn&rsquo;t say anything. I smiled, because we had all just had a fun time watching a movie together. After a few minutes, I felt sort of gross that I had thought reading about a fictional universe years ago made me somehow better, geekier, than other people who clearly enjoy the same things as I do. I love when I discover a shared interest with another person. I should revel in that. The more people that go out and fill entire theaters to watch the types of stories that I have loved for years, the more of these movies will get made. Being &ldquo;that guy&rdquo; is completely counter to that goal. I really, deep down, just want everyone to love what I love. I don&rsquo;t think it matters why or how they love it. But seriously everyone. The mind gem was right there in Loki&rsquo;s staff the whole time. Come on. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI remember leaning up against the stair railing in my grandmas house. She was watching Star Trek First Contact for the first time. I had seen it twice in the theatre and at least one more time when it came out on video, so I had it pretty much committed to memory. I was just passing through the house on my way somewhere, but I had stopped to watch the end of the movie with her. It would be more accurate to say that I stopped to watch her watching the movie. She was sitting intently, forward in her seat. She finished her cigarette about fifteen minutes before, but had been too engaged in the movie to light another one. The only other time that happened was when she was sleeping.As the movie draws to a close there is a sequence where a passing alien ship notices the warp signature of the first human vessel to travel faster than light. The aliens set down beside a small settlement in Montana, in search&nbsp;the people that built or flew that warp ship. More specifically, they are looking for&nbsp;Zefram Cochrane, the&nbsp;inventor of the ships engine. They step out of their craft, and you see that they look a lot like us, clothed simply in humble hooded robes. When the captain, or emissary, approaches Cochrane he removes his hood revealing his swept up eyebrows and pointed ears. They are Vulcans. At that moment my grandma let out a joyful whoop and clapped her hands. Her smile was three feet wide.  If you have even a passing interest in Star Trek you know how pivotal this moment is to the entire series. You probably knew who the aliens were long before the reveal. My grandma knew. She knew every frame of that scene before she ever saw it. You see, my grandma was a scifi nerd. I don&rsquo;t know that I have ever met, or will ever meet, anyone with a more encyclopedic knowledge of scifi and fantasy stories than her. Stacks and stacks well worn paperbacks from Andre Norton, Anne McCaffrey, Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein, among many, many others lined the walls of her room, and filled several more boxes. And those were only the books that she had kept. Countless other books and short stories lived in her memory, and she could recall the details of each with lighting speed. She would emphatically inform me of the difference between &ldquo;good science fiction&rdquo; and &ldquo;crap&rdquo; at any opportunity. I lapped it all up. What I didn&rsquo;t fully realize at the time was that my grandma was several thousand years old. In her life, she absorbed so many stories, so many past and future events, so many possibilities, so many eventualities, and she had weighed and considered them all. Intelligent machines, faster than light space travel, contact with alien life. These weren&rsquo;t figments of fantastical imaginings for my grandma. These were very real, inevitable events. She had lived each of them dozens of times, in dozens of ways. How they would actually play out was anyone&rsquo;s guess, but she had her favorites. Stories that were as romantic as they were real. Benevolent aliens, greeting us for the first time, with a warm handshake, like family we never knew. That was the kind of story she loved.Thank you for sharing your love of stories with me, grandma. I miss you. \t\t"

Yeah that thing. Well we are still doing it, and we have done more than 10 of them. I have been reluctant to invite many guests on to the show, since actually recording it and putting it together is more involved than a lot of people would be willing to deal with. I'm in the process of fixing that, and as you can see, we probably have room for one or two more at the table. Until I have it fully ironed out, here you go, you can enjoy this one below, and ten more like it over here&nbsp;. I am also setting up an audio only version, if you prefer to imagine what we are creating while we talk directly into your ear holes. Whatever, that's your business.&nbsp;       \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI've been watching a fair bit of E3 stuff this past week. During Sony&rsquo;s swing at the stage, the image of a sheepish looking Tim Schafer provided one of the only moments of light, but legitimate comedy. The crowd was filled with game industry veterans and industry press. As is the custom at public events, the joke was explained by a grinning Adam Boyes. If I had to guess, I would say that there was a pretty large group in that crowd, and an even larger group at home that didn&rsquo;t recognize Tim Schafer&rsquo;s face and actually did need the joke explained.As the audience of the game industry, it&rsquo;s not really our fault. We shouldn&rsquo;t really be expected to keep track of every developer, where they work, or what they have worked on before. Game development takes a team after all, and no single persons contribution should be considered more important than the rest. It&rsquo;s an egalitarian wonderland where ideas flow like water. Putting one person out there to represent the group wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to everyone else. Right? Right?You know what else takes a huge crew of talented people? Movies. I&rsquo;m thinking that most people could pick Steven Spielberg out of a crowd, and never once in his career did he work alone. Dozens, if not hundreds, of people work on his movies. But there you are, I just called them his movies. And so do you, when you go to watch them. When we say &ldquo;his movies&rdquo; it seems like we might be discounting the accomplishments of the other people who also worked on them. If you head over to Steven Spielberg&rsquo;s IMDB page you will notice something. The names Michael Kahn, Janusz Kaminski, John Williams, and a chorus of others appear on almost every one of &ldquo;his&rdquo; movies. This team of people working together is what makes a &ldquo;Steven Spielberg&rdquo; film. Unless you are a real film nut, or work in the film industry, you probably don&rsquo;t know or care about these other people, and you absolutely don&rsquo;t know or care what company distributed these movies. But you do know who Steven Spielberg is, and even though he is never actually on screen in his movies, you know what he looks like. How many people would recognize Shigeru Miyamoto on the street? How many people even recognise his name? We all should, since he&rsquo;s been making extremely successful games almost as long as Spielberg has been making movies. Here&rsquo;s the thing. People don&rsquo;t personally identify with corporations. They don&rsquo;t commit to memory groups of people. They remember single faces, individual names. If you see Paul McCartney, you don&rsquo;t think, hey there&rsquo;s the Beatles, you think, that&rsquo;s that guy from the Beatles. You recognize the man, not the group. recognition of that person brings with it some expectations. If you see the name Spielberg or McCartney or Miyamoto you should be able to expect a certain level of quality in the entertainment they produce. That their teams produce. You are more likely to watch, listen to, play, and buy things with those names attached. You might not know who Michael Kahn is, but if you go to Spielberg movies, he benefits. He gets to make another one.There have been very few game developers seen on the talk show circuit. I&rsquo;ve seen Markus Persson, Cliff Bleszinski, and, yes, Tim Schafer being interviewed on late night talk shows. And they were great. Just the same as any other guest, they came out funny and effusive. They pitched a game that they had worked hard on. The game they were proud of. They pitched it as the recognizable, smiling face of a an entire team. Around E3 time, when games are getting pitched and promoted, we should be seeing game developers on talk shows enough that they become recognizable faces to the general, game buying, public. They should have seen and heard Amy Hennig every time a new uncharted game rolled out, grew to associate her face with quality writing, and been poised to follow her to the new Star Wars game she is working on. It&rsquo;s recognition through repetition. If people know who she is and like her games, that team gets to make another one.The game industry is an echo chamber. If you are in the club, you get to know the people in the club, you get the inside jokes and the secret handshakes. It&rsquo;s insular and slightly defensive. An attitude that is inevitably self defeating. Maybe it&rsquo;s a difficult thing to really grasp, but there are people who like playing games, who will go out to a store to buy games, and they just might be excited enough about them to get to know the people who make them. They just don&rsquo;t want to have to learn the secret handshake. They really shouldn&rsquo;t have to. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - ArtilleryArtillery is one of the most basic physics equations given new form as a game. Artillery is one of the oldest computer games and new games based on the model of Artillery are released at a metronomic rate. Scorched Earth, Gunbound, Worms, Angry Birds. They are all descendants of Artillery. The overhand, targeted, throw is a fundamentally human trait. With very little practice, the overwhelming majority of our species can pick up some junk they find on the ground, instantly calculate the weight and balance of the object, raise it above their head, and strike a target several meters away with force and accuracy. Computing parabolic flight, compensating for wind, and predicting the aerodynamic properties of projectile is built into us. Enjoying the activity of throwing things is inherent. Artillery is throwing things, abstracted into turn based strategy on a 2D plane. Artillery also meets all of my criteria for both a game, and a computer game. It is a solvable, pattern based system where enough of the the calculable information is obscured, or random, that a balance of consideration and intuition is required. There is a specified purpose. That&rsquo;s it really. That&rsquo;s a game. Play it on a computer, or better yet, against a computer, and it&rsquo;s a computer game. Artillery itself, may not be the most memorable game ever, but the legacy of Artillery, the long and storied history of throwing stuff at other stuff video games, makes Artillery easily one of the best games.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI ask what they want for breakfast. They shuffle, bleary eyed, still asleep from the belly up. Eventually they arrive at the pantry, where they stare, bewildered, at the same row of breakfast cereals they see every day. When they finally do decide, I bustle around the kitchen filling bowls plates and cups, while they are magnetically drawn back to the couches to curl up in blankets and pillows. By this point, the questions have probably already started. &ldquo;So. In (insert game title here) (what is, how do you beat, how do you get) (boss, enemy, power up, mechanic)?&rdquo;The questions change depending on whatever game is currently being obsessed over, but the structure of the questions usually follow this pattern. Occasionally, when we have talked about games too much in a given span of time I will intercept after the &ldquo;So&rdquo; to ask &ldquo;Is this question about a game? Maybe we should talk about something else for a while.&rdquo; For someone who has, and continues to talk about games for an overwhelming portion of my waking hours, it seems even I have some maximum limit. Kids asking constant question on topics they are passionate about is not novel. As a child I was repeatedly threatened with the manufacture and employment of a rocket that would fire me into hyperspace if I didn&rsquo;t stop asking so many questions. The questions were probably about star wars or robots.Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I don&rsquo;t find this upsetting. I take full responsibility for the questions fired my way. I have both earned and cultivated them. Very little in my life gives me more joy, than talking with my children about topics that interest me. It&rsquo;s all very selfish in an anthropological sort of way. It&rsquo;s not so much that they ask their mom, and me questions near constantly. It&rsquo;s the content and subject of the questions I find interesting. They rarely ask anything about a show we have watched, a book we have read, or some other authored entertainment that we see. They recognise the surface meanings, and surprisingly often, some of the subtext of the story. They are familiar with the language of film, and the concepts of dramatic irony, not because we have gone out of our way to teach them these things, but because, like all of us, they are marinated in structured storytelling. Our culture, like most, eats, breathes, and bleeds storytelling. So they don&rsquo;t ask me about stories, they only ask me about games.I think it might be this. Games hinge on not knowing what will happen next. You need to use your own brain to determine an outcome. No one will author a solution for you, no one can script your course of action. Games require a random element. Another word to use would be mystery. Games offer mystery, secrets, puzzles, challenges. Games and play are how we test our ability to predict the future. How we have, since probably before having the language to describe it, used what we know of a situation to peek past the mystery and come up with solutions. Games are how we learn to solve our problems, keep us safe, and overcome obstacles. Games are how we learn to survive.As adults, we know that often we have to wander blindly into the unknown. There is no path planned out for us. No one else knows more about our current situation than we do. Sometimes, there are no guides. Children crave a guide. Someone to hold their hand while they attempt something they are unsure of. Someone to point out the danger spots, until they are brave enough to face them alone. They want to be assured that when they explore the unknown, you will be there to back them up. Several times a day, from now until they decide that I&rsquo;m a boring old man with nothing to offer them, I will happily field questions about fantasy worlds, secret caves, wizards, interplanetary travel, and diabolical puzzles. Here&rsquo;s the thing that my kids don&rsquo;t know about me. That part of me that used to risk being set adrift in hyperspace just so I could ask one more question, it has been asking all those same questions this entire time. It never stopped. I hope it never does. I hope that they don&rsquo;t either.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThere is no way to keep up with all of the new games coming out. It has become impossible. I have been attempting to follow the games industry for somewhere around twenty years. Okay, first thing. twenty is a thoroughly alarming number of years to do anything. Second, I can flat out guarantee that there will be a massive indie hit sometime next year. Third, I currently have no idea that this massive hit game exists, and I probably won&rsquo;t until it is available for download. I can&rsquo;t even fathom how a customer would find this game, or any other game that doesn&rsquo;t have a massive marketing budget. If it doesn&rsquo;t appear on the side of a bus, or on the front page of a digital store, the odds of most people, we&rsquo;ll call them customers, knowing about the game are microscopic.There have been a lot of people offering up half baked solutions to improve discoverability on Steam, XBLA, PSN, and the mobile app stores. Someone comes up with some notion that if we could only limit the selection, slow the incoming tide of content, or filter appropriate results, the digital stores could be &ldquo;fixed&rdquo;. Its like punching the wind. New games will not stop. New content will not stop. There are too many people creating new games, too many outlets for people to present their work and too many methods for other people to access and experience it. The profitability &ldquo;bubble&rdquo; may burst, but the flood will not stop. The mp3 was unleashed on the world in the middle of the 1990s. Never before, in the entirety of human history, did a sellable product have infinite supply and limited demand. Not only that, but the product would not degrade with age, was improbably portable, could be duplicated in unlimited quantities by laymen with cheap equipment, and while the industry could come out with a superior product, the one that people had usually suited their needs. It took many years of comically deep denial before the music industry realized even half of these facts. Most of them still haven&rsquo;t really figured out how to deal with it. People are still creating new music, because creating is what people do. Maybe I have your hopes up at this point. Maybe you think I have come up with a solution. A way to market and promote new games successfully despite the onslaught of competition. I&rsquo;m nowhere near that smart. It seems like no one else is either. There are some things that we do know. Digital shelf space is effectively infinite. One item does not have to be removed to make room for another. Ever. As long as a game is capable of running on a customers hardware, it can be sold. With hardware emulation, the length of time that a game could potentially be sold to someone stretches out to forever. There are limits of course. Specialized hardware and obsolete networks can make a game unplayable even if the old processors and whatnot are fully emulated on a more powerful computer. Movies have big marketing campaigns and really focus on the opening weekend. There is a good reason for that. A theatre can show only one movie on a screen at a time. If that movie is not making money, they have to get it out of there real quick so they can start showing one that does. A brick and mortar game store has a similar problem with shelf space. If a game isn't selling at the front of the store, it needs to move back and away to make room for more profitable games. That is not how digital stores work, but it is all we really know, so there seems to be an effort to frame them that way. Imagine this. There is a book store with neverending shelves. Every book ever written will be made available in this store. Even the newest stuff. They are cataloged in any fashion that suits you. Want to see the newest stuff? Want to only see only westerns? Want to take that list of westerns, and find the the oldest one with a main character named Dylan? The store changes to suit you. Customers in the store can claim independently if they like a book and assign it different rankings and classifications. Maybe a book set in space, about wagon train pioneers defending a settlement from bandits, shows up in sci-fi, western and Kurasawa. These stores exist already. They are steam, they are amazon, they are itunes. They should be reddit or metafilter. They should be better. The more user customizable the content search gets on any of these stores, the more useful they become. It isn&rsquo;t a matter of limiting selection, or promoting items to the front page. My frontpage should, if everything is working properly, look nothing like yours. Sure, maybe the newest stuff shows up on most folks front page, because people typically crave novelty. But I should be able to set how many items show up, and how long they linger on the front page. If I tell steam not to show me any new turn based war games, I should never have them cluttering my page. Maybe I&rsquo;m the type of person that would never buy one of those games. Advertising them to me is a waste of everyones time. As soon as customers are allowed to determine what they see on a storefront, the more likely they will create a store filled with content that they would want to purchase. Content they may not have seen otherwise, since those games, movies, songs, books, etc. would have been pushed to the back of the store.You might be able to see where this is going next. Those huge, multi million dollar ad campaigns that last for two weeks aren&rsquo;t really going to be effective for a game that a good chunk of your audience may not see because it doesn&rsquo;t show up on their version of the store. Add to that, the games sellable lifespan could, and should, be years instead of weeks or months. How many copies of Catch-22 sold last month? how many will sell next month? That book is over 50 years old, and with the help of amazon, and the infinite supply nature of ebooks, I&rsquo;ll bet it still sells. There are verified purchase reviews of it on amazon from this year. That means that a person cared enough about a 50 year old book, to not only buy it, but comment on it giving it a rating so that it can be more easily found by other customers. I&rsquo;m not saying that video games have the longevity that books enjoy. At least not yet. How much money was ever spent on advertising that book. It&rsquo;s not the stores that are broken. It might be the way games are being marketed, and market expectations, that need fixing.\t\t"

There are roughly twenty seven thousand tweaks, additions, and adjustments that I could still make. I suppose I could say that I hit a plateau. Every button is wired up and working. The sticks function beautifully. I still need to rig up a stand for the tv, but any TV or monitor could, as Intended, be used as a display. Smash TV plays great too, the only downside being that you can only play it single player. I can get around the shortage of arcade sticks by plugging in a 360 controller for a second player, but that is really missing the point of having a stand up arcade machine in your home. We'll say, for now, everything works great, and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.        \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Shogo Mobile Armour DivisionLet's get this out of the way. Shogo is sort of broken. It is empty, ugly, and glitchy. Sure, it is 15 years old, but it looked pretty poor at the time too. The plot is confusing and largely unnecessary. Movement is floaty, and combat is loose and chaotic. Shogo is also incredibly fun.Shogo is a heavily anime influenced FPS. You would think that the developers would be interested in only lifting the best, most exciting elements from your typical anime. Nope, Monolith went all in and wrote a convoluted plot with too many characters and over dramatic plot twists. It doesn&rsquo;t skimp on puerile humour and comedic levels of action and destruction. Shogo is as much a parody of anime as it is a celebration. The developers knew exactly what they were making and went for it.First and foremost, Shogo is a shooter. You play half of the missions as a man on foot running around shooting at bad guys. The other half, you pilot an enormous robotic war machine, but you also shoot bad guys. Both halves are very different, but equally fun. While on foot, combat is very unforgiving. Contact with an enemy can end with one bullet. Usually, not in your favour. You have to be careful, methodical, and accurate. Attempt to fight more than a couple of enemies at a time, and you will lose. Encounters tend to be more like solving ever evolving puzzles, than improvising with the environment and tools that you have available. In the giant robot armour you are a walking fountain of destruction. Only other Mobile Combat Armour pose any real threat. All of the weapons are mammoth and devastating. Your enemies carry similarly ridiculous firepower, and your mech suit can feel a bit squishy at times, but &nbsp;mostly you just skate speedily forward riding the wave of explosions. There is some sort of systemic alchemy at play here that keeps the game consistently satisfying.In a game where it gets just about every other superficial aspect so totally wrong, Shogo manages to get two very different styles of first person shooter play so incredibly bang on right. Shogo earns its spot as one of the best games. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tVideo games are weird. They started out weird. Presented as simulations of table tennis, but looking more like a display test pattern, the earliest video games asked a lot of their audience in the suspension of disbelief department. Aside from live college theatre, I don&rsquo;t know of any expressive medium saddled down with more abstract contrivances than video games. Cronenberg has nothing on Super Mario Bros. 2. Video games are some hip deep weird. There is abstraction designed into all games or sports. It is the abstract concepts of points and teams that lets us know that we are playing soccer, and not just running through a field fleeing from aggressive bandits that want to steal our ball. Video games contain all those same abstractions. What sets them apart from sports or board games is that they are also gleefully unconcerned with the need for physical laws, narrative structure, or other participants. This incredible freedom is yoked by the extremely rigid technical constraints of computer hardware. Take a these factors together, and video games become very, very weird.People have put good long hours into trying to make video games more realistic, cinematic, or literary. Turns out, that only makes them weirder. Point and click adventure games are pretty weird. Replace all the painted graphics with full motion video and live actors, and they get incredibly, uncomfortably weird. What started as a fairly slow and impenetrable entertainment genre quickly becomes a hodgepodge of dream logic nonsense, but now with more Christopher Walken. The residual weird from video games, has so thoroughly permeated popular culture at this point that the term &lsquo;level up&rsquo; is understood by the majority of the world's population. I'm fairly certain I've seen it used in advertising copy for real post secondary education. While that might be distasteful, pandering advertising, it does prove that they knew who their target customer was, and that they knew that the messaging would be understood. This is just one example of an otherwise meaningless collection of words spawned from the weirdness of video games. I won&rsquo;t even get into the nonsense that is currently growing out of the internet. The two cultures are very tightly tied together, and feed each other, becoming stranger by the minute. So what happens to a culture when a large chunk of it&rsquo;s voting population is well versed in weird? What does it mean when the new generation gap isn&rsquo;t based on the acceptance of variation on existing media, like hip hop or electronic music? I Honestly don&rsquo;t know. I figure we are so in it right now, it&rsquo;s pretty difficult to determine what the effects might be. If you came here looking for conclusions, you&rsquo;ve come to the wrong place. I have none for you.I am fairly certain of this though. The weirdness of video games has resulted in a generation gap. Several decades from now we will be able to look back and see what the effect was. If the past is any indication, the net result will probably be that a lot of people on one side of the gap will yell that the world was better back when, people in the middle will just ride the wave, and people on the other side will have grown up in a world that is a little more weird, and if we are lucky a little better. They will call it normal. \t\t"

The coin drop button isn't 100% yet, but I think I have that traced back to a poor solder. It shouldn't be too much trouble to fix. The second stick is sitting on the workbench ready to be hooked up, so that should be ready soon too. The sticks are Ultimarc Ultrasticks. They are analog sticks with a software setting for 4 and 8 way modes. I was a little concerned, since they were analog, that they might not be accurate enough for fighting games. Minutes after hooking up all the buttons and making sure they were all mapped properly, I was able to blast through half the roster in Super Street Fighter 2. When I reached an opponent I wasn't able to beat, it was due to my own rusty Street Fighter skills and not the controller. The tension on the spring is a little looser than I would like by default, so I might go pick up a stiffer spring, but other than that it performs extremely well. I have it hooked up to the laptop for testing, but eventually a the cabinet will be home to a small pc and modest sized HDTV will act as the display. Is it an arcade&nbsp;accurate gaming experience? No, not really. You also don't need to get tokens from a greasy haired thug&nbsp;and wonder what that sticky stuff is on the light punch button. Captain Joystick is part of a more civilized home arcade experience.&nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI attended a meeting? Meetup? What's the hip term to use? Get together? Hangout? Whatever. We had one of those a couple days ago. Some local game developers gathered together to share projects we are working on, or have worked on. Games that needed feedback to move forward. Games that needed feedback to reinforce that they are moving forward and not backward, or sideways. Games that needed feedback to take the next step. Game development, especially indie game development, can be terminally solitary. People spend a long time working on projects with very little outside help. I wonder how many promising games died for lack of constructive feedback. Of course, teams of any more than 4 or 5 can usually avoid the slow, painful death of their projects by simply talking with each other. One or two person teams are probably in trouble if they don&rsquo;t get out and talk to other people. I've heard about writers working in groups to provide each other with constant feedback for their individual projects. In one short meeting I was able to remember the brilliance of this method of working. I came away from the meeting thinking that I was probably on the right track, and I got a whole room full of different ways to move forward. Anyway, to make a meandering story short, if you are working on something, you should go out and get the opinions of some other people who also work on that something. You will learn a lot and it will make your work better. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tSo Facebook bought Oculus and a wave of disenfranchised nerd anguish washed over the Internet. Oculus had sold out to the man, and the taint of Facebook was on everything and everyone associated. Idealists everywhere cried foul, as if strapping what looks like half a brick to your face made you one of the goddamn sex pistols. &nbsp;Of course, given a little distance, a lot of people seem to think that the Oculus acquisition might not be such a bad thing after all. Myself included. I played Dactyl Nightmare in the early 90s. You had to stand in a inside a waist high restraining ring that kept you from tumbling off of the raised platform. Seems that putting an enormous plastic and glass mushroom cap on your noggin blocking out two of your primary senses tends to make grown person wobble like a toddler. The game looked awful. It played like a slow motion version of lazer tag where all the laser guns are replaced with ice cream cones, and the ice cream cones are prone to jamming. It was about as fun as it sounds. I also tried a version of Duke Nukem 3D that used a pretty terrible headset and a strange fps controller that I haven&rsquo;t seen since. The game experience was awful. It was also amazing and I wanted to play it again, immediately, and forever.We nerds have been fully on board with virtual reality since, I don&rsquo;t know, Neuromancer, Snow Crash, Tron, The Lawnmower Man, The Matrix, or countless other fictional examples before or since. Depending on how old you are, you can probably choose a cultural touchstone that introduced you to VR. You have probably been excited, and/or concerned about the prospect ever since. Regardless of what you think the effect of VR will be, fantastic, terrible, entertaining, addictive, or a passing fad, you know exactly what it looks like and how it works. There have been a lot of head mounted displays through the years. They were often marketed as VR, but none of them passed the test. We all knew how VR had to feel if it was ever going to take off. Funny enough, it&rsquo;s in the name. It has to feel real. Not &lsquo;real&rsquo;, as in a recreation of the actual world. &lsquo;Real&rsquo; as in a convincing place that seems like it exists. If virtual reality as an experience wants to get anything above a D- grade, it needs to at the very least look and sound like you are in a place that you are not.I tested out the Oculus Rift dev kit version 1 for about 10 minutes, and came away quite impressed. While this was not the matrix, or the holodeck, or whatever hyperbole marketing will drum up, it did give me a very convincing feeling of being in another place. The screen was of obviously low quality, and the motion tracking was slightly unresponsive at times. These are the sort of issues that people prone to motion sickness will have a lot of trouble with. Most people reporting on the latest version of the development kit say that these issues are largely resolved. That seems in keeping with what Oculus has been saying about the development of the headset, so that is a very good sign. The Rift might actually be the first head mounted display to crack VR. When the product actually comes out, it may provide the very real feeling of being in a different place. The good news is that it probably won&rsquo;t have to.There are a few other head mounted display technologies popping up out of the R&amp;D trenches. One from Sony. You can say what you want about Sony, but they have more experience with bringing head mounted displays to market than probably anyone else on earth. They held on to that particular niche product line much longer than was sensible. There is also the InfinitEye, which seems like the IMAX version of the Oculus Rift, bigger but not necessarily better. With a slightly different take on head mounted displays Avegant has the Glyph. The Glyph uses DLP chips to project the image directly into your eyeballs. Apparently this looks much more like a rectangular screen floating out in front of your eyes rather than offering an immersive experience. The display portion of this headset doubles as an ridiculously large headphone band. This will allow people on the plane to flip down their Glyph visor to watch Game of Thrones without exposing the people behind them to seven minutes of boobs per episode. For that reason alone, I suggest everyone refer to the &ldquo;flip down the Glyph visor&rdquo; move as the Dirty Geordi. You know he spent most of his time looking through the entire bridge crew&rsquo;s uniforms with that thing. So Facebook still bought Oculus. The plucky little guy sold out to the heartless behemoth right. What people sometimes forget is that money lends legitimacy. Right or wrong, that&rsquo;s just how it goes. That's not just legitimacy for Oculus, it's legitimacy for the concept of VR. Even if Facebook bought Oculus just to shutter it in six months, they spent a lot of money for the little guy. It means that other big guys will be more willing to buy up the other little guys, or at the very least, toss some money into R&amp;D. For all of us that have been waiting for VR goggles to become a real product since the 90s, 80s, or even 70s, we can now be sure that it will happen. Your long wait to jack in, sync up, punch deck, go cyber, or whatever will soon be over. There are a few things that any headset developer will have to add if they want to go mass market with one these units, like some sort of passthrough camera that can let the wearer see and hear the world around them, and rock solid motion detection contained in the unit. Of course, there is one way VR displays won&rsquo;t become a mainstream success. The games could still suck.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tHave you ever watched a wrestling promo? It&rsquo;s the part during a wrestling show where one of the towering, oiled up dudes wraps a meaty fist around a microphone and shouts angrily at his opponents. He will go on a tirade about how he is going to inflict all sorts of terrible harm. Any nation with laws would charge this man with harassment or assault. Of course, in the contrived, aggression turned up to 11, world of sports entertainment, this is all business as usual. It&rsquo;s all part of the show. In fact, cutting a good promo is better than part of the show. It is the show. Without a promo, the wrestling matches have no context. Watching a wrestler sell a punch seemingly intended for an air mass a foot and a half away from their chin would stretch anyones credulity. Watching that same wrestler stumble around dazed from the phantom punch, and then, a split second later, engage in some cirque du soleil style pairs tumbling, would snap it. A strong promo is the performers attempt to suspend your disbelief, before presenting a stage show that is wholly unbelievable. Most wrestlers now seem content to entertain during a promo, believability being a depleted commodity. So what does this have to do with games? You might wonder if I am so drained of ideas that I have decided to make a hard left and start writing about wrestling full time. Maybe, and no. I haven&rsquo;t watched wrestling with any regularity for at least 15 years, so I am far from an authority on the topic. I do have a point, but there is a bit of set up to get through. Now back to the wrestling. The wrestling promo has another purpose. As professional wrestling, or, to use the less disingenuous term, Sports Entertainment grew, so did the rosters of performers. The WWE is currently running live and pre-taped shows several times a week. Sure wrestling is &ldquo;fake&rdquo;, but it is also very physically demanding and there is always the possibility of injuries that take performers out of the show. These wrestling events have a lot of less experienced talent ready to play the fall guy in a match or two giving the headliners a chance to recuperate. Almost to a one, they are terrible wrestlers. This is why the promo is important. So any of the newer performers will be either awful or dull. It&rsquo;s a simple lack of ring time. If they were competitive athletes, only the ones that developed some actual wrestling skill would rise up the ranks. Of course they are not athletes, they are performers. Developing an entertaining persona through a combination of memorable matches and quotable promos is how a wrestler &ldquo;gets over&rdquo;. Getting over is winning. The outcome of the match, who pinned who, is part of the show, but ultimately unimportant. If a performer can get the crowd to cheer or boo, or increasingly, laugh, they win. It doesn&rsquo;t matter who holds the title belt, it matters who gets the biggest crowd reaction. So, again, what does this have to do with games? Okay, imagine this. There is a new wrestler that just came up through the ranks. He has polished his craft in relative obscurity for a few years, performing in small circuits and independent &nbsp;events. He&rsquo;s in pretty good shape, 6&rsquo;2&rdquo;, 220lbs, no prominent tattoos, close cropped hair. As wrestlers go, generic as hell. Add that to the fact that he&rsquo;s pretty new and as we&rsquo;ve established, awful in the ring. And there are 3 other guys who look and wrestle just like him. How is this guy going to get over? If they were actually in a physical competition, maybe he could play that angle. But they aren&rsquo;t in a physical competition. They are performers. He has to cut a promo and attempt to be the coolest, vilest, funniest, most frightening, most outlandish bad ass that ever walked the earth. For those three and half minutes, he has to believe it. There are a scant few examples of a developer who is able to properly promote their work, let alone themselves. We have the deluded view of the industry that game developers are mild mannered computer science majors, and quiet artsy types. It simply isn&rsquo;t true. No one actively seeks out a creative medium to hide with their head down. Worse yet, if a developer exhibits some sense of performance in their public facing persona, like Peter Molyneux or Cliff Bleszinski, they get called to the carpet for not measuring up to some preconceived stereotype. Games are entertainment products, not corporate finance software. Ritualistic business etiquette is not how games get over. It&rsquo;s not how game developers get over. I&rsquo;ve always been a reluctant salesman. I don&rsquo;t feel I have it in me to convince another person of something I don&rsquo;t believe. But I did act. It&rsquo;s been a long time since I did any acting, or any sort of public performance, but I still remember how it feels to draw an audience in. I remember what it feels like to believe the reality of a scene with enough conviction to sell it. It&rsquo;s sort of funny that, until recently I didn&rsquo;t really equate sales to performing. I&rsquo;m not sure why, since they are so obviously one in the same. Wrestlers don&rsquo;t have that disconnect. Cutting a promo is salesmanship. It&rsquo;s marketing. It is all those words that have become associated with swindlers and dishonest men. Maybe that&rsquo;s the problem. The words we use. Perhaps I should stick with the word performance. Cutting a promo is performance. If you want to get over with a performance, you have to fully believe it. At least for three and a half minutes. Strange how a group of people with fake names, fake vendettas, competing in fake combat only really succeeded by being extremely honest. I think, from now on, I&rsquo;ll take my marketing advice from wrestlers. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - PengoWhen I was a kid I would go over to a friends house to play games on his Commodore vic20. I would arrive under the pretext that we were going to play street hockey. Most of the time we actually would play street hockey, because hey, street hockey is fun. The entire time we were playing there was a tune playing in the back of my mind. It was popcorn, and it goes like this.          During the 80s there were about seven thousand computer and game systems that you could port your game to. A lot of games were written for dedicated arcade hardware that could easily cost 10 times what a home computer sold for. The code and hardware were so closely tied in a lot of the arcade machines that the circuit boards were usually one offs. A massive, expensive, collection of chips, wires, and printed boards would be used in one game and that would be it.Due to this level of specialization, porting a game from the arcade to home computers was more often than not, a ground up rewrite. You might have noticed that the video above was of a game titled ICE and not Pengo. If you could ground up rewrite a game faster than another developer, or better than another developer, and you couldn&rsquo;t, or didn&rsquo;t, get actual legal approval to do any such thing, you would put it out under a different name. That&rsquo;s just how it went. Once in a while a developer creating a clone of a popular game would have the decency to change the art or music as half lidded shrug toward copyright law. Cymbal Software, the creators of ICE, were about as brazen as you can get. This was the version of Pengo I would play at my friends house.I was aware of the arcade version of Pengo, but the only versions I had played at the time were the ones that were re-creations for the Tandy computers, Atari Computers, and of course, the Commodore vic20 and 64. They were much thinner clones of the original game. Still, I could tell that there was something more going on with Pengo than your standard maze chase game.&nbsp;All through the early 80s maze chase games, like Pac-Man, were common as dust bunnies. At first glance Pengo seems to be yet another in this genre. I&rsquo;ve even read it referred to as a maze chase more than once. Of course if you play it you will find that the Pengo shares very little with Pac-Man. First off, the maze isn&rsquo;t really a maze at all. Pengo&rsquo;s movement isn&rsquo;t really restricted in any way. If there is a block in your way, just push it and it will slide until it collides with another block or the edge of the screen. If another block is behind it, smash it and walk right through. It&rsquo;s not really a maze if you can make your own path. Pengo is action, puzzle, and strategy all at once.That&rsquo;s the really fascinating thing about Pengo. All of it&rsquo;s levels are randomly generated, so while you can create strategies, there are no patterns for winning the game. Planning, and reaction matter in equal parts. The game is a series of interlocking systems that you have to learn and exploit to be successful. I may be wrong, but I don&rsquo;t think there are many examples of unconstrained, systems based video games, like Pengo, from the early 80s. Pengo may be the earliest example of random level generation where the environment is actually a gameplay element. I could be wrong about this too, but I couldn&rsquo;t find any other strong examples aside from Rogue, but in Rogue the levels are fixed in place after they are generated, and not really subject to player manipulation. For it&rsquo;s time, Pengo is pretty unique.While doing some research on the game, I came across this gem. It seems that some folks have been reverse engineering the original game code to port it to different platforms, emulated and otherwise. While doing this conversion work one guy came across a bug in the original maze creation algorithm. I could go into all sorts of nerdy rambling about how he found that the code is self modifying so the program is actually changing itself as it runs so that the programmers can pack everything more efficiently into the limited memory and processor cycles available. Suffice to say, if you are the sort of person that would be interested in such a thing you should read this.&nbsp;Otherwise you should probably just watch these really cool videos of mazes being randomly created.&nbsp;         And just in case you missed it, here is Pengo and Popcorn again!       \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\t I searched around to find the original illustrator files I used to cut all the pieces for Captain Joystick, but I seem to have backed them up so well I may need spelunking equipment to retrieve them. You will have to settle for photos of the finished product.When I built my first arcade stick, I knew that I would eventually build a full size, stand up arcade cabinet. Captain Joystick, doesn&rsquo;t look much like the typical arcade cabinet. That was absolutely intentional. I had a few criteria when I started on the project. I wanted to create a stand up arcade experience. I&rsquo;ve never been a huge fan of sit down cocktail cabinets, which is probably a product of my particular brand of nostalgia. I&rsquo;m sure all those people who prefer cocktail cabinets have good reasons, I was just never going to make one. I had no interest in hauling around a giant 200lb MDF monstrosity full of exposed wiring and spiders, so converting an old Mortal Kombat machine was out of the question. I don&rsquo;t care for the CRT experience and I have no love of scanlines. I have a pretty firm belief that the play of a game does not depend on a certain combination of outdated technologies. I sort of like the crisp, bright image of PacMan played on a 1080p LCD screen. It&rsquo;s old and new all at the same time.&nbsp;          There were some arcade cabinets out there in the mid 90s called show piece cabinets or pedestal cabinets, where the screen and speakers were separated from the controls by a couple of feet. The controls were embedded in an oversized podium. Only the real big money making games were housed in these giant cases. Arcade operators must have hated them. You could probably fit 3 games in the same floor space. Computer hardware and displays change extremely quickly. The games I would be playing on this cabinet and their controls are cemented in time. The idea of having a control pedestal that I could hook up to any computer, game system, or display really appealed to me. If I was going to make a podium, and I was going to have a bunch of empty space underneath the controls, I figured I might as well make the best of it. I designed a stack of shelves inside the cabinet and put doors on both sides. For a while I had game consoles in there, but in the end it will likely be used to house a very small computer, and whatever junk I toss in. I designed all the milling files in illustrator and some router specific vector drawing software. I cut everything out of some &frac12;&rdquo; sheets of MDF and a &#8539;&rdquo; thick sheet of acrylic. The acrylic is inlayed in the top of the control surface. The router table is accurate to a few thousandths of an inch, but MDF is notorious for expanding like a sponge. Until I sanded the edges, the acrylic fit way too tight. On one particularly hot summer afternoon when I was working on the cabinet the acrylic bowed up and made a loud popping noise as the tension was released. It scared the bejesus out of me. The same expansion caused the doors to go slightly concave after I milled off most of the surface. I managed to fix most of these minor issues, but there are a few things I would probably do differently if I were to make a new one. I designed the space invader on the front, the swoop on the doors and the engraved text, so that I could mill them all out on the table fairly quickly, as I only had one night on the router table to do most of the work. I had planned everything out so that all the parts would fit together like puzzle pieces. The cabinet should be self supporting and fairly strong with no adhesives or fasteners at all, but I made sure to glue it all together and put a few screws in there, just for peace of mind.&nbsp;The paint is just a basic gloss acrylic, and I did it in a bit of a rush. At some point, likely this summer, I will have to disassemble the thing and give it several nice gloss coats, sanding in between. I really wanted the finish to be as bright and smooth as the acrylic on top. Only the edge around the controls is finished to that level right now. It doesn't quite have that monolith quality I was going for.&nbsp;All the buttons and sticks shown in these pictures were taken from my old arcade stick. I have since removed them and put them all in a new stick that I built for my cousin as a Christmas gift. The new buttons and sticks arrived a while ago and they should be a little more future proof than these ones were.&nbsp;Now I&rsquo;m in the final stages of wiring up the controllers. I have to wait for some connectors I ordered to arrive, since no electronics supply store in this town is open past 5pm. It&rsquo;s a small delay really when you consider that the cabinet has moved from our old place to our new place, and occupied every floor of our home for extended periods, without even once being used to play a video game. A few more days won&rsquo;t hurt.        \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI used to build signs. Lots of them. Aside from a couple of detours into advertising and sculpture, I built signs all through the aughts. I learned to use vinyls, acrylics, plastic, wood and aluminum to construct a pleasing storefront. I stuck stickers for the government. The first sign shop I worked at was fairly advanced for a small mom and pop. All the design was done using industry standard software. Not sign industry software mind you, software specific to sign manufacture is usually pretty terrible, this was the standard graphic design software. Illustrator, Photoshop, and their corel equivalents. When we had to we would use the sign industry nonsense too. We used that software to feed into several high end manufacturing machines. Several vinyl cutters, a heat transfer printer, a large format inkjet printer that could print a 4 foot wide image on pretty much any flexible material you could feed into, and last, but not least, a large computer controlled router machine. I was the new guy at the shop and I knew just about nothing. It took a while, but the crew there patiently taught me to use each of the machines, probably so I wouldn&rsquo;t just be in the way while they worked. I got fairly confident using most of them, but I was very reluctant to use the router. I can only justify my fear of the machine, by telling you that almost everything in a sign shop is either sharp or toxic, but the only one that could slice off all your fingers and keep on going, is the router table. I avoided using it for quite a while, but in the interest of having some workplace redundancy I became one of the people trained to use the router. I&rsquo;m not sure when it happened, but pretty quickly I was the only one using the thing 90% of the time. The main shop was very small, and the router table was a six foot wide 10 foot long piece of equipment that weighed roughly the same as a datsun. It lived across a parking lot in a two bay commercial garage that was only accessible from the back alley. I would stop at the main shop in the morning, pick up a few work orders, a cup of coffee, and head over to the router garage, sometimes for the rest of the day. I became very, very familiar with that particular table. I only drilled holes through it a couple of times. Anything I broke on it I also fixed. I calibrated it to a few thousandths of an inch, and tuned it until It could cut a sheet of acrylic and only scratch the protective paper on the far side. I got very good at using the router. A few years later I was at a different shop, operating a different router table, and I figured it was about time I built that arcade cabinet that I had been dreaming up. Next time I&rsquo;ll go over the design, and construction of Captain Joystick, the current incarnation of the ongoing arcade controller saga.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI started writing a piece about the building of my arcade cabinet, but I think it&rsquo;s important that I go back a bit. I just need to fill in the parts that let a reader understand why anyone would embark on such an endeavor in the first place. In 1998 I discovered MAME.I was sitting in the basement surfing on very limited dial up internet. Something had put it in my head to look up Legendary Wings. Legendary Wings is a Capcom shooter that came out in arcades about ten years earlier. During one summer, I had played the game an embarrassing amount at the local convenience store. It got to the point that I would walk into the store with one quarter in my pocket, drop it into the machine, and play straight through to the end. If I didn&rsquo;t manage to complete the game with that one quarter, I considered it a failure and left the store to ride around on my bike some more. I could do that three or four times a day and make a few dollars last for a week. It was no wonder that I would still have a fondness for what I knew to be a fairly &nbsp;generic shooter.During my search I found a few screenshots that were too large to comfortably download using my 56k modem. I also uncovered some information I hadn&rsquo;t been aware of, like the fact that the japanese release had different player characters to the version I had spent so many hours on. More importantly I found some people talking about how they had just played it. At home. On their computers. Witchcraft! Over the next couple of days I filled a ZIP disk with the MAME arcade emulator, a solid handful of mid 80s classic games and a couple other emulators with clever names like Nesticle, and Genecyst. Clever in a 5th grade sort of way. I had just downloaded a significant chunk of my childhood. I had a keyboard and an old, pre-thumbsticks gamepad as controllers. I could play a half way decent game of Excitebike on a keyboard, but it was only a matter of time before I felt the need to graduate to proper arcade sticks. &nbsp;About a year later I had access to broadband internet and the collection of arcade games grew well beyond the 100MB limits of a ZIP disk. I went hunting around and found that HAPP controls sold arcade parts to pleebs like me. I picked up a couple arcade sticks and a fistfull of buttons. I had absolutely no experience building arcade sticks, and really didn&rsquo;t have any materials to work with. I gathered up some scrap plywood, 2x4 offcuts, and a crap ton of acrylic paint to cover poor seams. When I told some friends at school what I was going to do, we had a small arcade stick building party. I used my scrap wood and the circuit board from an old gamepad. My friend used MDF and a PS1 controller. Soldering up the very fine wires to the even finer solder points on the board was tricky. I&rsquo;ve gotten much better at it in the intervening years, but I&rsquo;m sort of surprised that both sticks ended up working perfectly.I used that clunky stick for several years, until I finally decided that it was time to build a full arcade cabinet. As luck would have it, I had become a CNC router operator by then, and had access to both the tools and skills to build something more impressive than a scrap wood box. But I&rsquo;ll cover that next time. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tMy son pronounced aluminum 'aluminium'. Youtube has become an entertainment medium unto itself in this house. It would likely become the go to viewing option if some people here had their way. Of course it might anyway. Between youtube, netflix and the rest, I feel like scheduled television is fighting a losing battle. We haven&rsquo;t cut the cord just yet, but I feel like it&rsquo;s inevitable. When they fire up youtube on the computer, tablet, or Ouya, there are a small number of channels on speed dial. These channels all have a few things in common. They usually have a very strong Minecraft focus. This isn&rsquo;t terribly surprising, since my children also have a very strong Minecraft focus. They tend to be hosted by individuals with the superhuman ability to talk without breathing for fifteen to twenty minutes and remain unwaveringly upbeat about it. A solid half of them also seem to be british. At least that explains the &lsquo;aluminium&rsquo; thing.A few of the favorites are StampyLongNose, The Diamond Minecart, Paul Soares Jr., and Zack Scott.It does make me think. Is that what it takes to be engaging. Is talking in a chipper voice while doing something that people enjoy watching all you need to do. Now, please understand, I&rsquo;m not belittling these youtube personalities. Quite the opposite. I&rsquo;m in awe of the simplicity of what they create. What they are doing is not unlike sportscasting. The activity that they are commenting on, Baseball, Hockey, Starcraft, or Minecraft, a lot of people find inherently enjoyable to play or watch. They would watch or play it in the absence of the a running commentary. So what makes the commentated version more compelling than watching the live event, unfiltered. Why do some people prefer football on TV over going to the stadium to watch the game? It is storytelling, plain and simple. Listening to a person describe the events they see, possibly with some degree of insight, humour, or personal perspective, is an ancient form of entertainment. Maybe the most ancient. We are wired to tell, and enjoy stories. Lets plays and video game commentary are simply a new version of that. As traditional television flounders, we will no doubt see overproduced shows posing as &lsquo;lets plays&rsquo; and vlogs. That sounds unapealing. It probably will be. In the meantime, the Youtubers will get better, more polished, but in their own way and on their own terms. They, like all storytellers will play to their audience. The difference will be, that they will play to their audience without producers, publishers, or gatekeepers. The audience will decide what succeeds and endures. There will be modestly popular youtube channels that commentate horticultural fairs and niche gatherings of button collectors. This is no more or less valid a story to tell than Football, Baseball, or Minecraft. Everyone has a story to tell and an audience who will listen. Youtube isn&rsquo;t an advance in communications. It is a global society, remembering how stories are told, and the importance of allowing everyone the chance to tell them. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Beyond Castle Wolfenstein Everyone played that 3D shooter. You probably had a shareware disc or a disc with a handwritten label that said Wolf 3D. The one where you ran, gun outstretched, through squared off tunnels shooting nazis all the way. Wolfenstein 3D was great wasn&rsquo;t it. &nbsp;Beyond Castle Wolfenstein isn&rsquo;t that game.We played Beyond Castle Wolfenstein in school. We would stay in recesses and huddle around the computer. This was not a school sanctioned activity. Our school did have an apple IIe or IIc in all the classrooms, so this was really just the students making the best use they could of the resources at hand. Maybe a few teachers in the entire school district had half a clue what to do with these machines. The students knew exactly what to use them for. The disk was one that some kid had brought from home. Probably a twelfth generation copy, not even the distant vapor of legitimate retail lingered around it. No box, no manual, no nothing. We were flying completely blind. Every time we would take a fifteen minute run at the thing, we would learn new controls, and discover new secrets. Learning that you could crack locks if you didn&rsquo;t have the combination was revelatory. As was finding that you could hold up a nazi guard with an unloaded gun just so you could steal his bullets.It was Beyond Castle Wolfenstein and a trip to the school library that taught me who Eva Braun was. Before that game, I had never heard of her. While playing the game we discovered so many of her coats and diaries in locked chests and closets, I figured she must be worth looking up. Along the way I also learned about operation valkyrie, and figured out that they character you play in the game is likely a german resistance fighter, and not an intrepid allied soldier like some of the art would lead you to believe. So maybe it was somewhat educational after all. Going back to the game now, the mechanics are thin, and the content is unique but sparse. What you do see though is the beginnings of something else. The road is pretty straight from Beyond Castle Wolfenstein, and it&rsquo;s predecessor Castle Wolfenstein, to Metal Gear. This is one of the first stealth action games, even though it&rsquo;s light on both. Beyond Castle Wolfenstein is the prototype on which one of gamings most enduring genres is built. That alone makes it one of the best games.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI've had linux installed on at least one pc in the house for the last ten or so years. It will usually be some old, or underpowered machine that I can prod back to life. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll have a dual boot setup going, or just run a linux vmware image. It comes in handy, like when I had a hard drive failing and wasn&rsquo;t able to read it from windows. Typically I'll install it, poke around for a bit, and then leave it for a fe months. Mostly, I boot up a linux to update it, and then shut it back down. I&rsquo;ve often thought it would be great to use linux as my primary OS. The problem is that I use a lot of art creation tools. They tend to be very specialized, complex, and only on Windows or Mac. That will change, and here&rsquo;s why. When I went to school for animation we used Silicon Graphics machines. Ridiculously expensive workstations full of proprietary hardware and a unique OS called IRIX. IRIX was a UNIX based system that was made to run on these graphics powerhouses. Your average Ipad would run polygonal laps around those SGI machines, but they were the construction site for a lot of your favorite Jurassic Parks, Terminator 2s, and Jumanjis. I would say that &ldquo;at the time&rdquo; they were the best graphics processing machines available, but that wouldn&rsquo;t be true. By the time I was in school they were already being leapfrogged in the graphics hardware department. The fuel driving this innovation? Quake2.The big two in computer animation were Alias Power Animator and Softimage. There were a few other programs, 3DSMax and the like, but if you wanted to do some serious computer animation, you used those programs, or wrote your own. Outside of an R&amp;D lab and a few brave souls running WindowsNT, if you wanted to use Softimage, you used a SGI workstation running IRIX.In the early 90&rsquo;s there were no 3D acceleration parts for home computers, windows and DOS PCs, since there were no applications that required them. QuakeGL changed that. A whole slew of games started coming out around the same time, driven by the power of the polygon. A two dimensional sprite created by a talented artist might look nice, but it put serious limits on the kind of game you could make. This was the dawn of the first person shooter, and if you wanted to make a detailed 3d world that a player could walk around in, you made it out of textured polygons. The x86 and powerpc cpus in the PCs and Macs of the time were bunk at drawing polygons to the screen at any kind of acceptable speed, so dedicated 3D graphics cards started coming out. Fairly soon, the same raw power in those SGI workstations was available in a few hundred dollar graphics board you jammed into your home computer. Unlike the SGI machines, these boards were made to play games.Fairly early in my formal animation education, Alias released Maya. Maya is the successor to Power Animator, and was created by wickedly intelligent people. Being so intelligent, they determined that creating better tools was not enough. Instead they created Maya which is a platform and language that can be used to make tools. The fact that it persists to this day, more capable, but largely similar to that first version should tell you something. But that&rsquo;s not the kicker. Before the year was out, it was also available on Windows and could use the polygon crunching horsepower of those consumer 3D boards. I finished of my school year, often working from home on cracked copy of Maya, and bringing my scene files into school to render final frames on the network of SGI machines overnight.A lot of companies, including SGI, made high end &ldquo;PRO&rdquo; 3D graphics boards. They were (still are) very expensive beefed up versions of consumer hardware. Hardware designed to run games. We can be as high minded as we like, and say that computers are these fantastic multipurpose machines. We can say that every type of business and human industry has been positively affected by the computer. But what drove the development of the computer? Games. it&rsquo;s always games. What do people buy in enormous quantities to feed into each digital maw? games. What spurred the development and advancement of digital audio, video, memory speed, processor speed, specialized hardware, input devices, sensors, artificial intelligence? I could go on, but we all know, it&rsquo;s games. Games sold thousands of Commodore64s, AppleII varients, and IBM PCs. People will buy any device that has the most games available for it, and then other industries, like Alias creating Maya for Windows, will follow. If you want to sell your software, you put it where the people are, and people go where the games are. The entire computer industry has settled on a couple of hardware standards, so making your software talk to the hardware has become, more or less, a solved problem. All games are either made for X86 or ARM processors, and the incredible power of the current graphics chips means that most developers write to an intermediary language, like OpenGL, rather than trying to deal with the hardware itself. The small amount of overhead required by intermediary languages is usually acceptable. What developers are really looking for is an easy way to get their games to as many people as possible as easily as possible. Right now, the easiest way to get a game to as many people as possible is on windows, and probably through the Steam store. Valve, the company behind Steam is making a big play to try and get people to play games on linux. Except this isn&rsquo;t a big play at all. Valve are trying to get out in front of the iceberg.Alias Moved Maya over to windows well before the software and hardware were ready for it on that platform. Hollywood moves more slowly than the game industry. People making special effects for movies held on to their SGI workstations for much longer than they really should have, but by the time that they were ready to move on to new PC or Mac machines, Maya was already there, waiting. Where the games are. It has, with the advent of ubuntu, become fairly easy for a PC or Mac user to install and use linux. My last linux install was simpler than my last windows install, and I&rsquo;m a person with an abnormally high tolerance to digital knob twiddling so I already don&rsquo;t consider windows installs a real hardship if that tells you anything. If you like to surf the web and write a document or two you could do far worse than installing linux. You can run it on pretty much anything. You could probably install it on your kettle at this point. I know that a few people who have read this far think this is pure nonsense. Linux will never become the dominant OS, because business is so heavily invested in Windows. To anyone who thought this, you are looking at the wagon and you think it&rsquo;s pushing the horse. Business moves slow. There are businesses out there that still have vax machines in operation. If you want to know what a vax machine is, go look up mainframe in an old encyclopedia. That picture of the industrial refrigerator or washing machine that has &ldquo;computer&rdquo; written under it, that&rsquo;s a vax. Games go where they can run fast and sell to the most people in the easiest way. Games push computer technology forward.Most of the popular game engines now deploy games to android, a linux based OS that may be on your phone right now, as well as vanilla debian or ubuntu linux, or even straight to a browser where the underlying OS makes no difference. Linux, due to it&rsquo;s open nature, can become what people need it to be. It is already the platform that most of the internet is built on. Linux can and likely will, be made into the fastest, most stable game running platform available. &nbsp;It has become fairly easy for a developer with no interest in the esoterica surrounding linux to make their game available on that OS. Easy is the key. This isn&rsquo;t a revolution that will happen overnight, but it is inevitable. It might be a few years, but more games will become available on linux. If it&rsquo;s easy as pressing the &ldquo;build to linux&rdquo; button, why the hell would they not. Steam is probably the largest game store on the planet, they don&rsquo;t need linux. They aren&rsquo;t hoping to drive adoption of an alternate OS. Valve are opening up a shop where the products will be. Where the games go, everything, and everyone, will follow. It would seem to me that Valve want to be there waiting when they do. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tWell it was that time of year again. This past weekend I participated in the Global Game Jam.The basic premise of a game jam is that you gather a room full of folks who have an interest in making games, give them a topic for inspiration, and set them loose for a couple days. The participants run the gamut from professionals, to amateurs, to enthusiasts with no previous experience. At the end of the weekend every single participant will have created something that didn&rsquo;t previously exist and they will have learned something they didn&rsquo;t previously know. A game jam is the kind of creative refuelling that can propel a person, or a whole team, for a good long time.It can also be gruelling, frustrating, and tense. At about the halfway point, not one part of your game will function exactly like you imagined. Likely it will be in such a miserable and precarious state that it will feel like the game won&rsquo;t ever play properly. You will probably have a few wins. Brief glimmers that hint at what the game could be. Those are usually enough to power you through all the setbacks. This year I was on a team that really took a swipe at something ambitious. We laid out a concept that was more than we could ever accomplish in 2 days, but very quickly trimmed that down to something potentially doable. A bite sized chunk of the larger concept. We divided up the work efficiently, and everyone seemed to have a really good idea of what it was we were trying to make. It was a very collaborative, creative experience, and everyone was able to contribute in ways that played to their strengths. Just all around a really good time.I was going to do a postmortem, 5 things that went right, 5 things that went wrong. I think instead I&rsquo;ll just jot down a few things I learned.Prefabs are your friend. Prepackage as much stuff as you can early on. Make smart building blocks. Physics engines will rarely act in predictable ways, but they can be the most useful tool in the box. Like a table saw, use physics engines carefully.Always make a very simple test level, minus all bells and whistles. Test any concepts and functions there first. I rarely remember to do this, and I always regret it.Bring your glasses. My eyes are still pretty good, but 12 hours of unblinking computer work will tax younger eyes than mine. I sometimes forget how old my eyes really are.Bring some slippers. They are nice on the feet.A good team makes work more fun. (I knew this one before, but it never hurts to reinforce it)Our game prototype is up at the global gamejam site and can be found at the end of this link. Please give it a spin, and tell me what you think. http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/third-law\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI got the old board game Dungeon! for my boys for Christmas. Well not the old one. The new reprint version with the very impressive dragon on the top. I remembered it being a fun game, but that may be a false memory. I was fairly young, since the game came out the year I was born. Now that I really think about it I most likely saw some older kids playing it once. Maybe.The boys and I played some RPG Kids, a simplified rpg system, over the summer. It was fun, but there is something about game rules and easy to grasp structure that at least my kids gravitate toward. They get a bit lost In an open ended storytelling rpg system. They like set rules and consistency. They like having a good sense of where the game is going. They like knowing the rules, so that they know which ones they can break.We played a few games of Dungeon! on Christmas day, and a few more after that. We started changing the rules during game 1. Our game now resembles nothing close to what comes out of the box. For example, we play a co-op game. The original is a score chase game. More like Monopoly or Sorry than an RPG adventure game. From my observations kids are ok with losing, but really not okay with being beaten. When we lose, we lose together as a team. Working together we have added or changed most of the rules. As it turns out, Dungeon! is a tragically barebones experience, but it&rsquo;s also very malleable. Probably by design. Seeing as these are the same people that created the original Dungeons and Dragons I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it was a game created to be a template only. Here are a few of the things we have changed or added.We have wandering monsters in the hallways. You have a chance of encountering one of the monsters from the chambers on your journey, and they will chase you or head toward the entrance if they aren&rsquo;t defeated. We changed the winning and losing conditions to be more co-op friendly.We added special abilities that allow more teamwork and give groups of two or three adventurers a much better chance at surviving the higher level monsters deep in the dungeon. If you have ever played D&amp;D you would recognize most of the abilities as being class appropriate. The thief has a backstab, sneak, and detect traps, for example. We are in the midst of adding HP and possibly XP. We might be adding more magical loot. If we ever arrive at a stable set of rules, one that hasn&rsquo;t changed a couple times during a playthrough, I&rsquo;ll post it up here or make it publicly available. I think it really is a great game, but maybe not as is. If you&rsquo;re not opposed to picking up a great framework that you can build a game around, then you could do much worse than Dungeon! It also helps if you have kids that like to roll dice and consider the relative merits of wandering vs. stationary monsters. At length. Incredibly great length. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI'm usually a woman. Let me come around and take another pass at that. I usually play a female. Maybe not usually. More like often. That is to say, in games where you can choose either a male or female character, I often pick female. I realize that there is almost no way to bring this up without seeming skeezy. That&rsquo;s not why I play the characters I play. At least I don&rsquo;t think so, but that might require more introspection than I&rsquo;m capable of. I&rsquo;ll attempt to explain. The time worn quote uttered by many a gamer dude is &ldquo;if I have to look at a characters butt for 40 hours, I want it to be a female butt&rdquo;. This is laughable nonsense. Nathan Drake, Marcus Fenix, Kratos, Leon Kennedy, Ezio Auditore, Snake. Litteral weeks of my life have been spent looking at these digital male butts. I suspect that other gamers have done the same. Never once have I heard the complaint that someone wished Marcus Fenix had been a woman so that they can look at her butt. I might complain that Nathan Drake&rsquo;s butt looked flatter in the last game than it did in the earlier ones, but that isn&rsquo;t really what I want to talk about.Like most people I tend to gravitate toward more attractive and interesting character designs. Let&rsquo;s be perfectly clear. Nathan Drake is designed to be attractive. He&rsquo;s handsome, rugged, rakish. If you are a guy and think that this doesn&rsquo;t affect you, you may have some things about yourself to figure out. It does. That&rsquo;s why he looks like that. That attraction to the character is largely subconscious, and typically not sexual. Still after a few minutes you probably don&rsquo;t notice the character at all. You only see what he is aiming at.I have spent so many hours planted firmly behind a butt at this point, I barely take notice of the character on screen. Why would I. The player character acts only as an anchor for the game camera to pivot around. I&rsquo;m usually only paying attention to what is out in front of my character. The actual game part of the game. Where my character is only matters in relation to the obstacles in my path. Who my character is matters even less. It&rsquo;s all that game happening in front of the character that matters. The gender of that butt just doesn't matter.I played the hell out of Mass Effect. I played as much as I could of each game, before moving on. I tried to do a second play through of ME1 and ME2, but only got a short distance in before stopping. My Commander Shepard is tough, considerate, kind, ferocious, and willing to obey conscience over orders. She is also slightly awkward socially, military before manners. She has short hair, but long enough to push the boundaries of regulations. She is also possibly of indian descent, back when that sort of thing would have mattered. She was born on another planet, far from any terran political boundary. When I attempted to play through as the unmodified male shepard, I had to stop. This was not his story. Those were not his words. They belonged to the other Shepard. The real one. My Dovahkiin character in Skyrim is a Redguard. She carries two swords and shoots fire from her hands. I played Knights of the old Republic twice. One character was female, fair skinned and bald with a green lightsaber. The other was male, dark skinned, mustache, but also bald with a green lightsaber. My character in Saints Row is usually female, but sometimes male, sometimes a toilet, and sometimes a ridiculous nightmare creature that runs naked through the streets wearing a top hat and a full face tattoo. It's worth noting that none of these characters are dressed in skimpy outfits. They wear heavy armour and carry heavier weapons. They are geared up for what the game demands, which is usually ample combat. The thought of boob armour and warriors wearing six inch heels into battle gives me the screaming heebie jeebies. I find it offensive, not just to women, but to a basic sense of practicality. Also, I lied. Sometimes they wear skimpy outfits, but only if it has some comedic value.Obviously all of these characters are just my personal take on these archetypes. Each player gets the opportunity to create their own Commander Shepard or Dovahkiin. There are limits to the character creation tools of course. Within those limits, players can create any character they want. &nbsp;This is where we get into why I think I create the characters I do. I'm a 6 foot tall white heterosexual male 30 something of some pan-european descent, born and raised in North America. We'll shorten that to one word. Default. Hero of big summer blockbuster movie? Default. Hero of romantic comedy that plays in theatre against big summer blockbuster? Default. Hero of sci-fi fantasy epic where over half of the characters are rainbow hued aliens and creatures? Default. Villain in all previous examples? Default. You can take it from here. Why? Why is someone who looks like me (likely more handsome and fit, but still) the default. Who determined that this is default? When I walk among actual humans, something I typically avoid, sure I see quite a few people who look like me due to where I live, but the majority of people don&rsquo;t. At least half of the people I see are female. A lot of the people I see are not white. The default, is not, in fact, the default. Turns out, there is no default. Just a bunch of people. All different, but, more importantly, all kind of the same.I want to see the tough as nails space commander punch the fluids out of some evil alien dirtbag. I want to see the chosen one march up to a towering horror from the depths of the earth, sword in hand, vengeance in heart. I would like to see that person be a woman. Just once in a while. Please.I know there are examples of characters like these in movies and books and what have you. They are extremely rare. As long as people think that there is a default hero it seems unlikely I&rsquo;ll see many of these women in movies or on TV or in games anytime soon. Lucky for me, there are other games. Games where you can create and act out any character you like. It only takes a few sliders to be something other than default.\t\t"

Robotron gives you epilepsy first and then gives you seizures. If you already had epilepsy, boom, now you have double epilepsy. Robotron destroys the tendons in your left wrist and then offers you a second joystick for your right. Berserk has 7 robots on the screen. Robotron has 47000, and they ride jet skis. Geometry Wars has lots of graphical style. Robotron uses a colour pallette only fully visible to birds. PAC-MAN has a glitchy kill screen. The kill screen in Robotron is a prison shank swiping at you from the coin return. Dark Souls is hard. Robotron is calculus written in diamonds. The Last of Us has a dark, heartbreaking story. Robotron makes you the protector of the last human family, then forces you watch as it kills them in 7 seconds. Robotron kills you 3 seconds after that. Also, it took your money. The audio for Robotron was recorded with a 2 string bass, played by a nail gun. Robotron 2084 is Google&rsquo;s end game. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tOur kids will have childhood memories of their own. Memories that they will think are super awesome. We will scoff at them as somehow not as great or authentic as our memories. We will be wrong of course, just like our parents were wrong, and just like they will be wrong when they think the same of their kids.A lot of Minecraft and Terraria gets played here. Not much of it gets played by me. I enjoy these games, of course, because they are enjoyable. They are created to be enjoyed. They are not really made for me. Not specifically at least. I am an adult, and I have a certain amount of agency in the world. I have aquired tools, physical, mental, and emotional, that I can use to subtly tune my environment. I can make things. I can change the things that other people have made. Don't like that shade of teal, paint it orange. Don't like the wall, knock it down and rebuild it. Don't like your wireless performance, upgrade your network. The world is plastic. It takes effort, or money, or both, but it can be changed. I learned this by playing. Sure I've had jobs that furnished me a whole host of skills, but I learned none of them through the dutiful application of labour. I learned by playing, tinkering, messing around. I take things apart and reassemble them because it is fun. It's play. Nothing I've had to remember to function competently at a job, the bureaucracy of the tasks, has stayed with me. I could tell you all about applying vinyl wraps to vehicles, because sticking vinyl to things is fun. Changing your environment is fun. When you are a kid, your agency in the world is muted. Filtered through an insulating layer, often for your own protection. But you are able to play, and the play most kids gravitate toward will provide them with that agency. Minecraft and terraria have player agency in spades. They are building blocks. They are Lego. It would be very easy to say that in some way playing with blocks and Lego is more authentic. A better way to play. That, of course, would be wrong. Different skills can be learned by playing with physical toys, and I don't think that any good can come from not providing them to your kids, but digital toys will be as super awesome a memory for most kids as anything else they obsess over. If minecraft can instill in a kid, the inherent plasticity of the world I think it's a net positive. Sometimes you should go kick a ball around too. That makes for good memories. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tIn a flurry of de-clutering, I went and boxed up a metric ton of magazines, some as much as 20 years old. This collection is composed of a solid PCGamer core with layers of Next generation, Play, and Game Developer forming the outer strata. Orbiting that are large flat rings of Computer Graphics World, Digital Video, and Computer Gaming World. Several smaller satellites contain issues of British game magazines and PC hardware magazines. The realization that I would never again crack the cover of any of these periodicals probably hit me two residences ago. Still, I Jacob Marley'd these magazines from place to place, confounding anyone good hearted enough to help me move them. I figured that the last move they would make would be into the recycle bin.After attending last year's Global Game Jam, I had it in my head that maybe there might be another place to give all of these magazines. Since I so rarely look at, or even think of, these magazines it took me until very recently to ask the University of Calgary library if they would want them. The Taylor family digital library hosted last year's ggj and there they had the largest library collection of video games and consoles for academic research, at least in Canada. I'm not aware of more extensive collections, but they probably don't want to upset some librarian in Italy who is very proud of the pile they had amassed. Video games are a very modern invention, and like most modern inventions, not lacking in documentation. No one has been able to pinpoint the invention of chess, but Al Alcorn, the creator of pong is 65 years old and very much available for interview and comment. As is Ralph Baer, the man who invented the Magnavox Odyssey, the console where Alcorn cribbed the concept for pong. The ensuing legal battle is also well documented. Stored in boxes in my basement is 20 years worth of documentation. Maybe no one will ever open these magazines and they will sit quietly moldering on a shelf, or the University will simply scan them all into digital documents and recycle the paper. Either way, I would like to think that some day someone will be doing some research on the Atari Jaguar and will manage to find the infamous Next Generation interview where Sam Tramiel spouts all forms of nonsense. If nothing else, they will be entertained for a few minutes. If you have any interest in these old magazines, they will be available at the UofC library sometime early next year. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI've had cause, recently to do some video editing. Even though any editing ability I may have built up through the years has atrophied to a crippling degree, I'm still enjoying it. You can click here to see what I&rsquo;ve been editing, or you can read on to find out the what, why, and how of the project.Like most people who grew up in the 80s, I first experimented with editing by starting and stopping two vcrs tethered together with coaxial cables. I was pretty terrible at it. Later on, we would use a friends video camera and \"edit\" by simply checking the tape after every take and rewinding and recording over anything that didn't measure up to our extremely low standards. When I was in University, my uncle handed me a box of software that no one in his company had any interest in. I'm not sure if it had been sent as demo software or somebody had bought it and never used it, but any knowledge about where it came from is likely lost to time. That box of software is the reason I do half the stuff I do today. In the box was a copy of Truespace, the program that got me started in 3D. There were also copies of Coreldraw, and Photopaint, Corel's answer to Adobe's illustrator and photoshop, a few other assorted applications. Slightly more obscure, there was a copy of insync:razor. Razor was a revelation. You could load in video clips, cut them up, move them around, and add simple effects like chroma key. Never once during all this video rearranging did you have to worry that you would ruin the original footage. You could make as many copies as would fit on your tiny hard drive with no generation loss. Sure my computer only had the memory and raw power to deal with about a second and a half of postage stamp sized video, but it was still pretty amazing. During one of my film classes, we shot and constructed a movie on SVHS and beta tapes. We had access to a fairly high end editing station,at least at night when no one else wanted to use it. For all it's button pushing and T-bar pulling whizbangery, I knew I was using yesterday's tech. It would mark edit in and out points in a timeline and wind the tape back and forth to match, and then copy the contents of one tape, arranged according to your edit timeline, to another blank tape. If you were very lucky, the audio would still be in sync with the video 15 minutes later. At home, I animated, rendered, cut together, and dumped out to tape, opening titles and credits for the movie. By myself. With a 486. I&rsquo;m sure digital editing was a big deal already by that point, but it probably cost a fortune and required dedicated hardware. This was one outdated desktop pc. Things were obviously changing.Almost 20 years later, I&rsquo;ve been using Lightworks. This is an open source (depending on who you ask) program that can be had for free, or very cheap if you want some extra features. With it you can edit, in realtime, full HD or better video and audio. I&rsquo;m not 100% clear on the companies business model, but it seems like they are aiming to be the ubiquitous youtube edit platform, while still offering extremely expensive editing hardware and software to professionals. Lightworks is a niche product in a niche market, but Adobe should probably keep their eye on it. A free, or very cheap photoshop would very quickly squelch any open source upstarts like Krita and Gimp.And here is what I&rsquo;ve been making with Lightworks. A friend and I have been attempting to record a weekly chat and draw session, with increasingly successful results. In time I hope to turn it into a regular show, with other creative types presenting something they are working on. Illustration, programming, animation, video editing, fx work, sculpture, photography, whatever they do presented realtime on screen while we chat about pretty much anything. From time to time, the conversation will turn to something that one of the presenters is working on, and information about a person's particular process will be revealed in a much more natural way than any tutorial series. Hopefully we can continue to make it more interesting and entertaining as weeks go by.        \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Wing CommanderDon&rsquo;t bother going back. You can&rsquo;t. Time has eroded this game. Wing Commander a cultural relic that pushed technology, and craftsmanship forward. It plowed, and then paved new roads for future creators. This game created new verbs. The first time I played Wing Commander was on a 286. It sported vga graphics and an adlib sound card, but it was still barely able to run this game. The front of the machine housed two floppy drives, a 3 &frac12; and a 5 &frac14;. Through some trial and error and delicate file shuffling, I was able to make the game think that several floppies were, in fact, a single drive. This let me play without ever seeing an &ldquo;insert disc&rdquo; screen, just so long as I could deftly swap disks when I heard a particular &ldquo;cachunk&rdquo; noise. It&rsquo;s worth noting that I could only do this because the the game was a pirated copy that everyone passed around school. I would feel bad about that, but I went on to buy every game in the series. I still have cd, dvd, and/or digital versions of all of the Wing Commander games. The digital version of Wing Commander sits now, installed on my thoroughly modern computer. It is almost unplayable. Maybe it was just too far ahead of it&rsquo;s time. Maybe it always suffered from rough edges and 23 years have cast them into sharp relief. But after 23 years, the music, presentation, sense of sweeping adventure, that hasn&rsquo;t aged a day. After 23 years, Wing Commander still stands as high water mark. One of the best games.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI rode my bike this morning, yellow trailer rattling along behind me. The boys were stuffed snuggly within its canvas walls. The clear vinyl window fogged up from their breath only feet from the driveway. They may not be able to see very well, but they are warm and safe back there. Moments after we arrive at school, they are quickly hustled into the glow of the hallways. Doors briefly pop open and teachers poke their heads out into the icy wind just long enough to usher another kid indoors. Picking them up, I opt to drive. The bike cart sits too low to the ground and the drifts are already knee deep in places. It would be like pulling a hundred pound snow plow. Blowing snow cuts at our exposed noses and cheeks. If we turn into the wind, our eyes are all pin pricked and blink blinded. I regale them with stories of frozen toes and frostbit cheeks. They respond with suitable awe, which is uncharacteristic, but I&rsquo;ll take it. \t\t"

I don't remember last week.We'll you said that Adventure Caddie would launch this year. Yeah. I might have said that. And the year is almost over. Yep. Yep. That's true. So? So, yeah. I suppose that won't be happening. So, why then? Well, okay, here it is. I figured that by the end of the year I would have something ready enough that I could post it up as an alpha and have people test it out. Launch can really mean a lot of things in these crazy modern times. So then nothing this year? Nope. Why not? Where did you drop the ball? It's pretty easy really. I didn't get enough art done to get the game into a presentable state. Rich has done a great job on the programming end, and it does sort of function, but I haven't finished nearly enough assets and gotten them game-ready. The game works, but there is nothing to do yet. It's a 100 piece puzzle with 7 available pieces and some of those are taken from other boxes.Is it ever going to get done?Yeah. Oh yes, definitely. I&rsquo;m working on those assets right now. I can only work about 2 uninterrupted hours a day, so it&rsquo;s slow work.That sounds like an excuse.You&rsquo;re probably right. Yes, you&rsquo;re right, it is. I&rsquo;ll work harder. So when will people be able to play with it?I&rsquo;m not doing that again. Learned your lesson?Yes. No more promises. It&rsquo;s done when it&rsquo;s done. Can I make deadlines, but just not tell everyone?Yes. In fact, I think you have to do that. Sounds good. So Adventure Caddie, still working on it, and it will be available&hellip; sometime. Works for Blizzard. Not fair. They have all the money. Bah, give it up. You don&rsquo;t have any problems.You&rsquo;re right. Okay, fair enough. Thanks, me.No Thank you, me.\t\t"

Wait for a few minutes and try again. Go to take a leak, try again. Sit down to eat, try again. Several times a day I&rsquo;m hitting the google servers, checking for the latest update to android. My Nexus 4 works great. I have never had any problems with it. Most of the features that are getting an update are useless to me anyway. I barely leave the house and I have so few appointments to keep track of, that any reason to venture out is a celebrated event. I don&rsquo;t typically need any reminding, scheduling, or instant communication with \"the office\". I'll just check one more time before I finish this paragraph. The proposition of a new update to any device in the house makes me salivate. There is no good reason for it. Most of the time these things are in the house because they currently do the job we want them to do. I just want them to do that job a tiny bit better. I'm jonesing for a firmware upgrade. From time to time one these 'upgrades' &nbsp;will actually break something that was previously working. I've been at this a while and I'm fairly confident in my ability to fix the problem, or at least work around it. For anyone who has to deal with my upgrading, it must be like watching someone dance around pulling levers and turning valves while a rickety steam engine shakes itself apart. I'm deeply sorry but I need my fix. I went ahead and manually updated the Nexus 7. That involved a multi pronged attack of driver installation, Linux terminal commands, and hardware recovery modes. I think it's worth mentioning that the Nexus 7 was functioning just fine before the update, and there are no new features that anyone here will ever use. I could do the same to the Nexus 4, but I thought it would be okay to wait for the Google sanctioned over the air update to arrive. The phone is, after all, my primary means of communication if and when I do leave the house. For now I will keep checking to see if the update is available every half hour or so, even though it will make little to no difference once it actually is installed. I might have a problem. I think the PS4 came out this week too.&nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Alpha CentauriI used to keep my copy of Alpha Centauri stowed safely in the bottom drawer of an end table, deep in the back, nestled under old papers and envelopes. This was for my own protection. Now it sits in the bottom of a box, stored under the stairs in the basement. This is also for my protection. Alpha Centauri is almost guaranteed to make me sick. Civilization was a loose computer adaptation of the board game of the same name. I love, and have loved, the Civilization series on the PC. It is a solid strategic empire building game, a micro-detailed version of Risk. You have to be simultaneously aware of the global military mechanics, and, municipal level, social and economic dealings. You can, in equal parts, out fight, out negotiate, out research, or out spend the rest of the world. All these machiavellian interactions are set against a scrambled world history that borders on satire. Gandhi is often played as a loose cannon with his finger squarely on the nuclear button.Alpha Centauri picks up where Civilization ends. Humanity has left the cradle of earth to seek a new home, the extra-solar planet Chiron. Nations lose all meaning and the small population of immigrants become divided by extremist ideology. Most of the gameplay and mechanics that make Civ a great game are still in Alpha Centauri, and some, like the custom unit creator are vastly deepend. Exploration, city management, combat and negotiation with other factions are handled similarly to previous Civ games. What makes Alpha Centauri a step above the rest of the Civ series is the setting and the tone. Where Civ picks and chooses events from across human history, the story in Alpha Centauri is linear and evenly metered out. Where Civ will play events for satire, Alpha Centauri tends toward the deadly serious. Quotes and writing from history dot the Civ series, but most of the writing in Alpha Centauri is wholly original, and, more often than not, disquieting and poetic. The Civ series alway boasted exploration and discovery, at least in the early stages of each playthrough. With the exception of a few barbarian tribes early on there is very little danger in exploring or expanding your territory. Chiron, simply referred to as Planet, is the harshest of frontiers. The crust of fungus that covers planet will push against your territories with increasing ferocity as you expand outward. Unthinkable terrors known as mindworms act as Planets native defence, overcoming your explorers with psychically projected nightmares before burrowing through their flesh and bone. &nbsp;Planet does not want you. It is made very clear that you are the alien. As the game progresses, and the story unfolds, you discover that you are not playing a game of simple mechanics and management. Alpha Centauri is a playable novel with a rich narrative, and a lot to say about the awful nature of colonialism, extremism, and the human drive to dominate. It also has a lot to say about human endurance, adaptability, acceptance of being of the land and not it's master. That story is what keeps me playing until the wee hours. It's that story that I can't put down. That is why I keep it safely tucked in a box in the basement. If I started playing it I know I would have to see it through. I know I&rsquo;ll play it again, some day. Or three consecutive days. It will probably make me sick. That&rsquo;s why Alpha Centauri is easily one of the best games ever made.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\t \t                  \t\t \t   I&rsquo;ve been using a new digital art tool called Mischief. I sent a tweet a few days ago that said&ldquo;I'm gonna be real hyperbolic and say that I think this is as significant a technology as the textured polygon.&rdquo;I might have been more accurate to compare it to subdivision surfaces, or adaptive tessellation, but the implication is similar.&nbsp;Photoshop and other raster art programs like it, represent images as a collection of pixels. Each pixel is like the atom of the picture. The fewer the pixels, the less information is represented. If you scale up or down a pixel based image the missing information is interpolated. You can&rsquo;t add detail to an image after it&rsquo;s been created. You know that technology on cop shows where they go &ldquo;zoom in and enhance&rdquo;? Yeah, that&rsquo;s nonsense. If you zoom in on a pixel based image, you see bigger pixels.&nbsp;That&rsquo;s where vectors come in. A vector image is a set of curves plotted on a 2d grid. You can refine the grid as much as you want and the curve will remain smooth. Zoom in on a vector image and the computer will redraw the curve to display it as crisply as possible for your display. Vectors are made up of lots of points connected by calculated curves. While this is much more memory efficient than pixel graphics, it is also a lot more restrictive, and takes a lot of planning and forethought to create anything that isn&rsquo;t complete garbage.&nbsp;Mischief uses, what they call, textured strokes. Each stroke is vectorlike, in that it is a mathematical representation of a curve, or series of curves, but it also contains other information like stroke width, stroke intensity, and interactions with underlying strokes all controlled by stylus pressure. What this means is that you can sketch an image and then blow it up, shrink it, or rotate it without having to interpolate any non existant pixels. So no artifacts. Mischief uses a computer to do what a computer does, display a representation of something that only exists as an equation.&nbsp;Anyone familiar with 3D or vector art tools will instantly grasp what Mischief, or tools like it promise. Using digital tools to create things that can only be created with digital tools. Now I&rsquo;m going to go back to working out how to use it as resolution independant texturing tool.&nbsp;   \t                  \t\t \t \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI don&rsquo;t remember a fear of the water. There may have been a time that I wouldn&rsquo;t blow bubbles, wouldn&rsquo;t dunk my head, wouldn&rsquo;t open my eyes for fear of that chlorine sting. It seems perfectly reasonable, but I don't remember that. During a stint in the 90's, I had to imagine, every day, what that fear feels like. In high school I worked at the local pool. It was a pretty good summer job. I was, and still am, about as awful a swimmer as a person can be, while still being competent enough to lifeguard. As a swimmer I was a passable thrasher, but I think I was a decent teacher. I liked teaching swimming lessons, even though guarding was much less stressful. Watching over a vat of human soup was pretty easy money, but watching a kid learn something, that was way more fun. There were two different types of swimming instructor. There were the ones who tried to burn through the half hour sessions by doing the same few drills, songs, and games. If they were charged with a group of older kids, kids who wouldn&rsquo;t instantly sink to the bottom of the pool if left unattended, some instructors would stand on deck hollering in orders army sergeant style. Other instructors always got into the water. They always looked into the kids eyes when they talked to them and listened for a response. They were sometimes loud, but they never shouted. They didn&rsquo;t direct the kids to play games and do drills, they played games with them. Not because it was their job to play, because it was fun. They smiled. I always tried to be that kind of teacher.Teaching is all about empathy. You can be amazing at something. Mathematics, juggling, programming, knitting, swimming, whatever, but if you can't imagine being new to it, afraid of it, you can't teach it. Period. No exceptions. A good student might be able to learn from watching you, but that doesn't make you a good teacher. I don't remember being afraid of swimming, but I desperately tried to understand that feeling every time I asked a twitchy 4 year old to jump off the side, promising I wouldn't let her sink. Recently Andrew Price of Blender Guru has proposed some modifications to the Blender UI. While it seems that most people agree, the very first responses were acidic, even personal attacks. I'm sure it's demoralizing to the people at Blender Guru, but it seems like they expected that sort of reaction. Andrew seemed to know what he was getting into. Andrew seems like a good teacher. If you've read any of my previous commentary on Blender, you will know that I really like it, but I find the interface actively hostile toward new users. I'll cut through it, because I have a decade or so of 3D modelling and animation behind me, but I really empathize with the fear and confusion a new user must feel. There are users of Blender demanding loudly that the child be allowed to sink. I shouldn't have to point out how this doesn't benefit the student or the teacher. Of course this sort of reflexive response is rooted in another kind of fear. Fear born out of inertia. Complacency. Fear of losing status. Fear of letting &ldquo;the wrong type&rdquo; of people into a clique. I suppose the only thing for it, is to teach. Try to empathize with their position and say &ldquo;it&rsquo;s okay, we&rsquo;re not going to let you sink.&rdquo;So far as I can tell Andrew has done exactly that. Here&rsquo;s hoping the stewards of Blender are good enough students to listen.   \t                  \t\t \t \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI think I can safely say that the one movie I have seen more than any other, is Aliens. The first time I saw it was in my hometown theatre. I was probably too young to go to an R rated movie unaccompanied by an adult, but they didn't tend to care much about that in the 80's. I left the theater fascinated. Years later I would to watch a poor second or third generation VHS copy of Aliens almost daily. I knew every line of dialog. I could close my eyes and replay large chunks of the movie, shot for shot, in my memory. I would pause the tape, adjust the tracking to reduce the squiggly lines, and then sit with sketch paper on a TV tray for hours, trying to approximate my favorite frames. Or half frames. This was a bad VHS tape, after all. Aliens is a tentpole movie for video games. Aliens, along with Evil Dead 2 and The Thing, have been cited by id software, the creators of Doom, as inspirations. According to a few reports, id was even in negotiations to create an Aliens game around that time. The nod to Aliens is probably pretty obvious to anyone who has played a first person shooter game. Tension, narrow tunnels and military action was pretty much the blueprint for the early FPS game. Now I have to admit, the first 30 or so times I watched Aliens, I probably didn&rsquo;t catch a lot of the more subtle moments. Being a teenage boy I was much more interested in watching pulse rifles shoot space monsters, than any character subtext. Watch a film enough times though, and eventually that stuff starts to sink in. I was in university when Doom came out. I played the shareware episode until my eyes glazed over. I played the Aliens total conversion over and over. The familiar sounds, and pixilated but recognizable sights, were an easy sell. it did make me think though. They really only captured one small sliver of this film. It was an enjoyable, but hollow experience. Something was missing.I took a few film classes in university and during one such class, we were tasked with analyzing a single film and comparing it against a filmmakers body of work. While most of the class went off to watch Bergman, Fellini, and Coppola movies, I headed straight for James Cameron flicks. At that point his newest movies were True Lies, and the screenplay for Strange Days. I knew Aliens well enough that I probably didn&rsquo;t need to watch it to write the essay, but I did anyway. I think that maybe it took playing Doom, for me to realize it, but I was able to put into words what made Aliens different from other popcorn action movies of the time. Aliens is all about relationships. Specifically family relationships. The only reason any character does anything in Aliens is to protect their family. Except Burke, but I&rsquo;ll get to him later. Doom has no relationships, no story at all really. It was interesting to discover that, in the original design document there was a plan to include a great deal of story in Doom. Characters with histories and motivations, and leading them, a career focused female protagonist. While none of that ever showed up in the final game, maybe not all the strengths of the inspiration were lost on the guys from id.Aliens on the other hand is all about family. What constitutes a family, how family members support and help each other. The lengths someone will go to, to protect their family. It&rsquo;s about love. There is a scene near the end where Ripley storms into the lair of the alien queen to retrieve Newt. Having lost her own biological daughter to old age while she slept, adrift in space for 57 years, Ripley has taken Newt as her adopted daughter. Ripley's motivation to enter the queen&rsquo;s lair, is love.When Ripley comes face to face with the queen, they are surrounded by hoards of the creatures. Every surface has become a hiding place for dozens of aliens. They are also surrounded by alien eggs. The creatures could easily swarm down from the walls and ceiling, overpowering Ripley and Newt. The queen instead communicates to them that they should hold. In that moment the audience is is shown the motivation of the queen. She and Ripley are not so different. They are both acting to protect their children. Their family. The queen is motivated by love. Going through the James Cameron catalog to that point revealed very similar themes. The Terminator movies are the story of parents sacrificing everything for the love of their child. The Abyss is about the distances between people, and how love can exist even when communication is difficult or impossible. True Lies is a remake of a French film, but both are about family struggling to stay connected. Strange Days is about unconditional love, and the positive and negative consequences. The villains in James Cameron's movies are all motivated but selfishness and greed. In Aliens, the creatures are a force of nature. They are antagonists, but not villains. They act only to protect and grow their family. Carter Burke and, by extension, the Wayland Yutani corporation, &nbsp;are the villains. They are selfish and greedy. They sit counter to our heroes, who are loving and self sacrificing. I'm not saying this is a realistic portrayal of human interaction, but it's not the norm for action movie characters, who are typically driven by vengeance, anger, and malice. I had come to the realization that James Cameron wrote 'chick flicks'. The stories were all rooted around themes of love and family set against white knuckle action and explosions. They were Trojan horse movies. Audiences and, maybe more importantly, studios thought that big, loud, explosive action is what blockbusters are made of. Turns out that seeing characters driven to action by love, is really what puts butts in seats. Take a story that would otherwise be classified as sappy, and lash threats of the apocalypse, or maybe a sword fight, to it. Now that's a movie. I handed this conclusion to my professor thinking this may not go so well. I was attributing fairly nuanced meaning to films made by a B movie director who had managed a lucky bit of casting early on. These were action schlock, right? Certainly not Wild Strawberries, at any rate. When my prof asked me to talk with him about my essay, I still figured he was not on board with what I was claiming. Not only was he on board, he wanted to talk with me about how he had thought that the original Alien was a superior film to Aliens, but he might have to change his mind. We discussed the merits of each and how they both advanced genre film, but I maintained that Aliens also advanced film storytelling, through its theme of family. While I'm sure a lot of people still won't attribute much importance to a silly sci-fi action flick, I was pretty ecstatic about it right then. Of course James Cameron would go on to make that boat movie. Titanic, for all its period piece splendor follows the same formula. It is about love and the loss of innocence. And still, every action taken by the protagonists, is for love. The villains are driven by selfishness and greed. In Titanic, the formula is laid bare. What was hidden beneath high concept action, is now out in the open. But still, the movie works, because love is what moves the story forward. It's the only thing that, satisfyingly, can. So what about game stories? What about Doom? Game characters are typically driven by fear, anger, revenge, malice, or just nothing at all. How many of them are driven to act out of love? How often is love even considered? I can think of Lee Everett from The Walking Dead,&nbsp;the wanderer from Shadow of the Colossus,&nbsp;maybe Booker DeWitt, and Comstock, from Bioshock Infinite. As written by James Cameron, games are a medium full of villains battling villains. Maybe Doom would have benefited from a hero motivated by love. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tStoresThe new consoles are almost here and the entire gaming press is wringing hands and wagging tongues. There is a lot of talk about what the hardware can or can't do, different online strategies, and social networking hooks. I think it will all come down to the stores.I&rsquo;ve said before how I think that this generation will see the end of disc based games. Discs certainly have a function, that is, allowing people to easily and quickly store, transport, sell, purchase and run a huge volume of data. By the time you drove to a store, purchased the latest Naughty Dog Game, and then returned home to put it in your PS3, the download of the same game would only be a fraction complete. Network speeds are nowhere near what they need to be to reliably deliver tens of gigabytes of data to millions of players. But that&rsquo;s only if you have to download the whole game before you can start playing. Netflix, youtube, and Hulu only exist because video can be streamed. If you had to wait for the entire movie or show you want to watch to be downloaded in it&rsquo;s entirety, none of them would function. In fact the web would barely function. stuff gets streamed to you everytime you open your browser. Little bits of information gradually filling in the mosaic of a web page. Games, to this point haven&rsquo;t had to worry about streaming. They were all contained fully in plastic cartridges and plastic discs. A few massively multiplayer games on PC use streaming to shorten the wait times on players while kilometers of digital terrain downloads in the background. To be fair that aforementioned Naughty Dog game, The Last of Us, could be played after 50% of the game had been downloaded to your system. The Last of Us is a 50GB game, so 50% of that is still going to take a handful of hours on fast broadband. The new consoles have streaming built into the architecture. A downloaded game should be playable within a few minutes, while the bulk of the games content continues to download in the background. &nbsp;So here is what is going to happen. A year or two into the new consoles, a couple of premiere titles will appear as a download first, or even download only. One of the smaller publishers will stop putting games on discs. Not long after, disc releases will be a novelty item reserved for AAA, top sports franchises, and special edition releases. How on earth can I be so sure? This already happened on the PC a few years ago and, with the inclusion of streaming at the system level, the consoles are positioned to follow. The PS3 store started out as an abysmal mess. Through the years it has improved massively. The current PS3 store is almost as simple and user friendly as Steam, GOG, or Origin, which is saying quite a bit. It has a little way to go before it can equal those services, but it&rsquo;s more a matter of evolving the current system and layout. The XBox 360 store started out janky but not unusable, became quite usable, and then became a miserable pile of smoking garbage. The store on the 360 is a slow rolling train crash, that Microsoft seems to be unwilling, or unable to correct. Seriously, when you put an item on sale it probably means that you want to sell that item. A lot of that item. You put that sucker right up front in everyones face, you don&rsquo;t bury it 7 layers deep. Do they use their own interface? Its madness in there. I haven&rsquo;t really used the Nintendo E-Shop recently, so I&rsquo;m not sure how it stacks up. From what I remember, I would classify it as &ldquo;serviceable&rdquo;. On the PC Steam and GOG are juggernauts. They have taken the lessons of Amazon to heart and created stores that actually help you find what you are looking for, and present you things you didn&rsquo;t know existed. When the discs fade away, these stores will be where the games will come from. Providing a place for customers to actually find and purchase games will be more important than any minor variance in hardware clock speeds or internal memory bandwidth. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tOuya updateWell holy flying weasel balls! The Ouya is actually working! I can turn it on and have both picture and sound. Like, &nbsp;both, at the same time. On the same old ass TV. How can this possibly be? This was the issue. Our TV is one of those older, HD ready jobbers. This means that is can display a 720p signal or a 1080i signal but not a 1080p signal. The TV has a dvi input that can downscale a 1080p signal into something that it can use, but dvi doesn't carry sound, only picture. So to get both the picture and sound out of a single hdmi cable, I had to run it into a converter that split it into component video and stereo audio. So I went and got the thing that did that and filled all its holes full of cables. Turns out the converter box is smart and the tv is stupid. The Ouya is putting out a 1080p signal and the converter diligently converts and then passes along that 1080p signal to the tv. The TV then promptly failes to display anything useful. Knowing that the ouya can put out a 720p signal, I went looking for any way to lock the output of the little grey box to that lower resolution. I even tried sending terminal commands to it from my pc. No dice. I thought that I might be able to have the converter tell the ouya to output a 720p signal, but the converter is having none of that. It's a completely non discriminating converter. If the ouya says 1080p, well that's good enough for the converter. Converter don't judge, man. And so, the ouya sat there for weeks, building up a tangy dust frosting. Until this:&nbsp;http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2359390That's the thread where some kind soul created and posted a set of mods for the Ouya. One of them purporting to lock the hdmi output to 720p. I tried it. It worked. The Ouya now sends a signal that all the digital nonsense between it and my eyeballs understands. So now that I have all that worked out I can finally give you my impressions of the thing. It runs xbmc real well. \t\t"

It sat beside a Jackal machine, or Top Gunner, if you&rsquo;re a heathen. Since you could drive a Jeep over dudes and launch missiles at tanks in Jackal, Bubble Bobble didn&rsquo;t get much love. But while you stood there fighting tyranny, or whatever it was you were supposed to be doing in Jackal, that Bubble Bobble machine was bleeding pure joy.&nbsp;Everything in Bubble Bobble floats. The bubbles your little dinosaur creature exhales zip rapidly across the screen before drifting lazily upward. The enemy creatures you trap in those bubbles rock gently like leaves on the wind. Your jump follows a slow breezy arc, rising briskly and falling back down with a sleepy pace. Gravity is daydreaming.Happy Music. Happy movement. Happy Game.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tFor a young medium, video games sure do soak in the nostalgia.&nbsp;Retro games, pixel art, 8-bit sound. These are badges of honour for the long time gamer. We were there when it was all new man. Games were better then. Fresh. Exciting. Everything now is just a rehash of a rehash. No one has any new ideas.&nbsp;What I have just described is a path to hipsterville, paved with the incomplete remembrances. No one wants a carbon copy remake of that old game. No one. You might think you do. The name of your favorite game might be in transit from your brain to your tongue right this second. Just hold on to that.I like a lot of older games, especially arcade games, but they are not how you remember them. Sure a lot of them are still fun. They are fun in exactly the same way as they used to be. Games do not improve with age, but neither do they degrade. You change, they don't.I used to think that somehow decoupling the art from the game so that it can be continually refreshed as new technology allowed, could make certain games evergreen. No need to design a new game, just make that old one look better. I could not have been more wrong. It's like thinking that printing a book on glossy paper will improve the prose.&nbsp;Pixel art and 8bit sound are valid expressive choices, just as black and white or bleach bypass is a valid choice for the cinematographer. But it is that, a choice, and it needs to be made with some consideration. Games were not better then. Nothing was. That's not to say that everything is better now. It's not. Everything is a product of its time. The only advantage we have now is that our options expand every time someone builds something new. That new thing, it didn't come out of nowhere. It is built on the legacy of every new thing that anyone ever came up with. Each thing, and each person a product of their time.&nbsp;So go ahead and make a retro game, make a game in a genre that isn't currently in vogue, even remake an old game, but do try to put something new in there. Something different that you came up with. That will give everyone who comes after you something to build on. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tCan you imagine Star Wars without John Williams score? Think about it. Pretty bleak hey. You end up with a serviceable plot slavishly cribbed from samurai films, full of B movie nonsense dialog. The set, character, and visual effects design would still be incredible, but it&rsquo;s filmed and presented in such a plain, workmanlike manner that it&rsquo;s difficult to take much notice. The one element of Star Wars episode IV that sets it apart from other films of it&rsquo;s genre, budget, and era is the music.If you watch any movies made before the 70&rsquo;s you will start to notice a trend. There are the occasional standouts, typically in the musical genre, but a lot of the music is largely interchangeable between one film and another. There are a few standard scene closing techniques that are used again and again to point out different changes in tension. The score acts as a pivot for these movies, but it&rsquo;s not woven into the fabric of the scenes. If you look up lists of the greatest movie scores, or just take stock of the ones that are permanently embroidered on your brain, the list skews very heavily toward the 80&rsquo;s. Most of this has to do with the steady advance of technology. Creating, refining and matching music to the images on the screen became much, much easier. It became a solvable problem. It wasn&rsquo;t that the music was better. People have been good at making music for a while. It was that the technology of music making and film editing had leveled up. They could work together in ways that were difficult or impossible before. Before the NES there are almost no memorable video game scores. There are sound effects and audio stingers, like the wakka-wakka of Pac-man or the dirge of the Space Invaders, that still resonate, but no real musical scores. During the 8 bit and then 16 bit eras there was a convergence of technologies that entangled music and gameplay in a memorable way.Most of the time the music would simply play on constant loop under the game being played. creating a piece of music that wouldn&rsquo;t be grating over the many hours a player could be listening to it was a true talent. Rather than have the themes tied to emotionally charged scenes in a movie, game music would drill itself into you through sheer repetition. There was another convergence that strengthened game music during that &nbsp;time. It was all at once and advance and a limitation. While storing digital sound was possible, space was at a premium on cartridges and early disks. Encoding the music, and playing it back through the same synthesizer chips that were also used to create all the games sound effects was much more practical. The positive side effect was that all the sounds, instruments, impacts, and shouts, come from the same source. Every sound in the game was unified with the same palette. The sound effects are the music. By the end of the 16bit consoles gameplay, art, music, and sound all existed on the same level. They created one consistent experience.Then CDs came along and broke all that. Suddenly musicians could create orchestral scores without limitations. They could record with any instruments, add vocals, whatever tools their film counterparts could use were fair game. For quite a while, it meant that scores for games actually got markedly worse. The game and the sound had fallen out of sync. Early polygonal games can be described as anything but visually artful. The sound and music had leapfrogged the visuals, and they were both weaker for it. Attach a John Williams score to some Tom Baker Doctor Who and you get the idea. Of course, technology always wins. It didn&rsquo;t take very long, one console generation and even less time if you were a PC gamer, &nbsp;before the visuals caught back up. Now there are dynamic sound systems that can fade themes in and out of the score depending on the players interactions. Songs don&rsquo;t simply loop under the actions, they shift and change, punctuating key scenes, wringing just the right emotion out of just the right moments. Film composers started to really get the hang of this art around 40 years ago. Now games are doing the same thing, only dynamically in real time. I could point to the main themes to Halo, Mass Effect, Metal Gear, Assassins Creed, and on and on. Musical scores for games are getting so good that most low budget indie games can sell a copy of the soundtrack for the same price as the original game, and be justified in charging it. I have gotten more enjoyment out of the soundtrack for some games than actually playing them. It&rsquo;s really a great time for game music. Can you imagine Halo without Martin O&rsquo;Donnell and Michael Salvatori&rsquo;s score?\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Trio the Punch - never forget meSome people go a long way for a joke. The makers of Trio the Punch went a long, long way for a joke that only they would get. Then they packed that joke up in an arcade cabinet. People could pay to play that joke and almost no one would find it funny. Trio the Punch is the Andy Kaufman of arcade games. Usually I write a Best Games about a game that is so good that I think everyone should play it. A game that will have universal appeal. Trio the Punch doesn't care what you think. It doesn't care if you like it. It has nothing to say. It is a fiercely, unapologetically bad game. The development team is probably still surprised they got away with making it. It probably still makes them laugh. I think every game developer should regularly revisit Trio the Punch - never forget me. You will come away from it having learned nothing about creating good games. That's okay, Trio the Punch doesn't care what you think. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tSo there are a couple new consoles coming out in a few months. I think I&rsquo;ll buy a new video card instead.I was never really much of a console gamer. That statement typically stirs up visions of PC gaming snobbery. Bearded dudes bragging about dual SLI rigs that push frame rates in the hundreds, while they play era accurate flight sims and grognard only, hex based, strategy wargames. That&rsquo;s not me at all. I was the kid who desperately wanted to play any and every game, on every platform. It just happened that the platforms I had were computers. Usually strange ones that few people had heard of. Every time I would go over to some kids place, and they had a NES sitting under the tv collecting dust because they had grown bored with, I don&rsquo;t know, magical wonder and awe I suppose, it would make my soul hurt. It might as well have been a puppy, and their whole family was making a conscious effort to ignore it. I would make trips to stores specifically to play the display model of whatever machine they currently had running. Multiple times a day. By the time I was in university, the 16 bit machines were in high gear. I kept up with all the new releases, reading magazines centered around consoles I didn&rsquo;t own. I would occasionally rent one of the machines, felt the SNES looked slightly better than the Genesis, but I never sided with either camp. At the time shareware had come the the pc, and I was playing Doom. I suppose, by default, I was a PC gamer, but I never felt like one. I just loved games. Time marches on, and I become an old, nostalgic man. I&rsquo;ve followed the industry consistently for over two decades. I have the current round of consoles, and we have played them a fair bit. As is my usual modus operandi, the 360, PS3, and Wii were all out for several years before I even considered picking them up. I will do the &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; for this upcoming generation too, but I have a hunch that I may never feel compelled to get them. It&rsquo;s been thrown around that the new consoles are &ldquo;really just a PC&rdquo;. This has actually been true for quite a while. The original XBox was &ldquo;really just a PC&rdquo;. The 360 and PS3 had more in common with older Mac machines than windows/x86 computers, but they can both be convinced to run Linux. The new consoles not only have similar hardware to your standard windows desktop, they are fraternal twins. They really are just PCs.I suppose the important thing to think about then, is what does this mean for games. If a game could conceivably be moved from PC, to Xbox One, or PS4 with almost no changes, what platform will developers build their games for? Unless they are paid to create an exclusive for one platform or another, they will build the game for the platform they build the game on, the PC. Oh sure, putting a game in as many places as possible will still make good business sense, so conforming to the limitations of the consoles will be important. They are slightly less powerful than a gaming PC and the de facto method of input is the controller. That is the spec games will be built to. Even for a game targeted to a console, releasing on PC becomes too cost effective to pass up. Here comes the caboose of the nostalgia train. There was a time, not so long ago, when press would gleefully proclaim the death of PC gaming. No stores stocked PC games in any volume, and they usually occupied a three tiered shelf beside the staff doors. A few things have happened since then, and now most major releases get a solid, often superior, PC release shortly after the console version. Digital stores are bursting with games in a full spectrum of price strata. There is no, one size fits all price, genre, or audience for PC games. My PC is decent, but not even close to top of the line. I&rsquo;m not aware of a single game available that it can&rsquo;t run.&nbsp;The new consoles are basically PCs and PC gaming hasn&rsquo;t been this healthy since the 386. Looks to me like we will all be PC gamers soon. I&rsquo;ll just get out ahead of it, and opt for the video card over the console. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBecause, video games. That's the answer I give to my kids when they ask me how any of these weird, inconsistent events could have just occurred on the screen in front of them. Why does this thing start on fire and this thing not? Why did that character just warp through the geometry of the floor? Why can I fly in this game but not in this other one? Because, video games. To someone who doesn't play these games, I think it can probably appear arbitrary. Anyone who has been playing games for a while will negotiate the internal logic of each imaginary world, almost by feel. It may be slightly chaotic, but there is a language internal to video games. Like all languages, it is living and plastic. The etymology is strange and meandering. The current syntax is unfinished and shows no signs of logical design. Similarly, the language of modern sport is internally consistent, but complete nonsense. I regularly strap sharpened metal blades to my feet, and clothed in plastic and foam armour, collide at 20km an hour with other grown men. When witnessed by an outsider this has to seem completely bonkers. It is. But it's also a lot of fun. I just finished playing Bioshock Infinite. The characters in the game are exceptionally well written and performed. The story is decent, not withstanding a few unrealized plot threads and a few holes patched over with \"handwavium\", it's on the level of your better, high concept sci-fi films. Better, but not best. Inception, not Bladerunner. Then there is the shooting. Bioshock Infinite is the latest in a series of excellent first person shooter games. The language of the first person shooter is fairly well defined, but it grows and changes with each successive title. It's a living language. It carries the baggage of its evolution, like a language does. Crates and barrels populate the first person shooter in numbers unmatched by the busier port cities of history. More combatants fall in battle, than the worst military massacres. Usually at the hands of the protagonist. These are the phonetics of the first person shooter. Because, video games. Film carries, in its language, methods of expressing compression of time, rapid traversal of space, and connecting characters with concepts using editing, lighting, and sound. None of this is realistic in any way, but it is a language spoken and understood by pretty much everyone. You will get that occasional viewer who constantly asks what just happened, not realizing that there are no extra scenes contained between the cuts. The story is being told deliberately, as the filmmakers intended. They have the same information as everyone else. The stories are told this way, because, movies. Because, books. Because, music. Because, poetry. Because, movies. Because, video games. The language of the medium informs it's structure. I often have problems with the disjointed way storytelling is handled in games. How heightened violence and action step on character development and narrative, and vice versa. I&rsquo;m probably one of the only people with a Y chromosome that didn&rsquo;t enjoy Heat for the same reason. I like me some violent movies and games, to be sure. Saints Row the Third is one of my favorite games in recent memory. It&rsquo;s unapologetically violent and ridiculous at every turn. Because, video games. It understands the language of the medium better than some of it&rsquo;s higher minded counterparts, and succeeds based solely on that. Bioshock Infinite uses the language of games impeccably to tell an interactive story, and to create an interesting, theme park style action shooter. Where it stumbles is in combining the two. It took decades for filmmakers to even begin to grasp the nuances of the language of film. That language is still evolving steadily today. Video games have only been in homes for a few decades, and the technology of the medium has only started to settle out very recently. understanding and speaking in the language of video games is far from a mastered art. Still, sometimes things happen on that screen that aren&rsquo;t weird and inconsistent. Sometimes things happen on that screen that are amazing, wonderful, affecting, and profound. Because, video games. \t\t"

I was going to do a writeup on how that went and what I thought of the system. It turns out that our TV is really dumb. It&rsquo;s one of those old &ldquo;HD ready jobbers&rdquo;. It can display a 720p signal pretty well and, aside from some minor overscan issues, does a respectable job with all the current game consoles. It doesn&rsquo;t have any hdmi ports, but it does have a DVI port and I have an adapter. All good. Nope.It will not play nice with the Ouya. The Ouya doesn&rsquo;t output analog audio at all. Not even through a headphone jack. My fault really, I&rsquo;m usually very good at sniffing out these weird hardware incompatibilities. I was blinded by the cheap price and potential for fiddling. So, to make up for this shortcoming, I purchased an hdmi to component converter. It works fantastically with every device I connect it too, except the Ouya.I feel like this is the point where most folks would pack it in and figure this junk just can&rsquo;t work together, because either it is broken, or the people who made said junk, are bad, vindictive, people.I have an uncommon tolerance to hardware jank. I will mess with something to get it running properly, or at least acceptably, far longer than I really should. Sometimes this pays off, sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t.At this point I have a small grey box that will send out picture or sound, but never both together. I have come up with a plan that involves an hdmi splitter and some RCA Y adapters. wish me luck. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tOur home has been afflicted with a devastating case of minecraft. It came on quickly and it has persisted longer than anyone expected. The children have been severely affected, but it's hard to say who suffers most. The desire to plunder the deeps is all consuming. Children well versed in the height of technological achievement are putting unprecedented thought into the gathering, smelting, and forging of base ores into crude excavation tools. I hear them sometimes, digging in the loose soil of the back yard with tiny plastic shovels. Discussion of minerals mundane and exotic, their uses, accretion depth, and relative rarity, floats aloft on warm evening air. Plans are made for future expeditions into the bowels of a fictional world. The coveting of iron and diamond armours full in their thoughts.Untold horrors lurking in the darkness carry great weight here. Scenarios and stratagems involving zombies, creepers, endermen, and the all powerful &ldquo;End Dragon&rdquo; are fodder for conversation at any time during waking hours. Even in the bathroom. Getting ready for bed, our youngest was banging vacantly on a wooden nightstand. When we asked him why, he could only answer that he was mining.He. Was. Mining. I know that is my fault. I brought the minecraft into our home. I'm the only one to blame. What have I done. \t\t"

I'm scared of exploring new mechanics only to come up against their limits. I'm scared of an isolating entertainment medium that few of my peers relate to. I have been playing video games for most of my life. Every time I start a new one, I'm scared. I feel nervous and anxious as the opening splash screens play. I spend some time in the menus so that I don't have to face starting the game proper. I feel disconnected from the controls and flail around for a while. I feel like I missed some critical training in the opening sequences. I'm lost. I don't know how to play this game, and I never will. Everyone else knows what to do, but I don't. I'm playing it wrong. I'm terrible at this game.I've been playing these things for decades. I played the first of them when they were new, and now I play the latest. Okay, I typically play them a few months after everyone else, but I've made my peace with that. As games became more complex and impenetrable, I kept playing them. I would go pretty deep, if it meant I could enjoy a new game. I was as scared of getting into Street Fighter 2 and Mortal Kombat in their time, as I am of most current games. Now I link together the motions and combos required as a function of muscle memory.Still that fear is there. Still, I play these games, and still I scramble to start a new one as soon as I complete an old one. For as much as they scare me at the start, I know that halfway through an entertaining 20 hour game, I'm going to spend 40 of the hours I&rsquo;m not playing, thinking about playing.I am invested in games more than any other entertainment medium. I put more mental energy into the hobby than most other things in my life. I genuinely enjoy most games I play, but still, I am scared to start a new one. If even half of the people who don&rsquo;t regularly play games feel this same fear when presented with the prospect of starting one, how in the world will the medium ever draw a larger audience?\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tShader TestI tried to get my interactive shader test to run properly inside this blog post, but that weren't happening. Instead I put it on its own page. You can click the link at the top or bottom of this post to mess around with it.&nbsp;I tossed a jumble of models together to approximate the kind of stuff that will go on at the top of the screen during the game. If you fiddle with the knobs you can adjust a bunch of the settings in the shader. It will freak right out when you first start playing with it, but you can pretty easily adjust it to something reasonable. There is only one shader in this scene and no lights. Everything is adjusted, tinted, slid, tweaked, and modified through careful use of a few variables.This is the link to the Shader Test\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThere are some things I don&rsquo;t understand. Can&rsquo;t understand, and probably won&rsquo;t understand. I don&rsquo;t think I have the tools to understand. I hope that I never do.Here is a fun little story that I think makes me look very stupid, but, I think, makes my parents look unquestionably brilliant. We used to watch The Nature Of Things regularly on CBC. I was, as most children are, fascinated with science, technology, robots, spaceships, aliens, volcanoes, and dinosaurs. If there had been a show with robot dinosaurs, piloting a volcano through space meeting aliens along the way, it would have been my favorite show. In fact someone should probably get on that.Anyway, we used to watch The Nature of Things all through the 80&rsquo;s. I have more than a few fond memories of laying on the carpet in front of a monolithic, wood clad, television tube, thoroughly entranced. Occasionally I would be allowed to stay up late to watch a particularly interesting episode that aired later than intended, usually due to a hockey game running long. Any episode that centered on robots, computers, or dinosaurs could usually hold bedtime off for a spell. As I got older and more of my evening time was spent at the rink, I would only watch the show sporadically. Usually, an episode about robots or computers or dinosaurs that would catch my attention, since I am perpetually locked at a mental age of 8-12. This time though, the topic of the episode was the human genome project. The projects goal to map out the entire human genome was not yet complete, so this episode aired sometime in the early 90&rsquo;s. That means I was in my mid teens. The host of the show, David Suzuki, told a story about how he became interested in science, nature, and most importantly, genetics. He described how his father had fostered in him an interest in nature, and exploration. He also went on to describe how he and his family had been placed in an internment camp during WWII. Listening to him recall this troubling story, at the age of at least 15 or 16, I realized that David Suzuki was japanese. -I have read a lot of the #1ReasonWhy and #1ReasonToBe comments on twitter. Most of them posted by women in the game industry, or women who comment on the game industry. Seriously, go and read some of these. When taken in aggregate, it paints a pretty bleak picture. What should be done? What can we do to improve this situation?Why did it take until my mid teens for me to realize that, David Suzuki, a man I watched explore the natural world as often as weekly, was japanese? Of course, David Suzuki is not japanese. He is canadian. As canadian as I am. As japanese as I am scottish/irish/french mutt. He&rsquo;s more canadian, If you take seniority into account. Aside from having the same last name as a cool motorbike, he was that science guy on TV. In other words, he was someone that I could aspire to be like, emulate, if i chose to. That is all the information my spongy young brain had to go on. That was how my parents let me picture the world. That a family could have their business and possessions taken from them, that they could be imprisoned due to a&nbsp;minuscule&nbsp;variance in their genome, simply did not exist for me. That a girl couldn&rsquo;t grow up to be an astronaut or an engineer, or a game developer did not exist. Maybe that was something that happened in a long gone, barbaric past, but we lived under the banner of the federation of planets. People were all basically equal. Only their circumstances were different. If you lived next door to me, we share the same circumstances, regardless of where you were last week, so we should probably go play Star Wars and Transformers. I realize that claiming ignorance of racism, or sexism, means that I am guilty of some unique form of both in some peoples eyes. I feel the positives outweigh the negatives. We try to make sure that our sons image of the world is this:Most people are good, but some aren&rsquo;t, so be careful. We are mammals, just like a lot of other animals. We do a lot of the same things.People come in different shades of brown and orange, just like other animals.People believe different things, but mostly for the same reasons. We like to live together peacefully, but sometimes we don&rsquo;t.We speak different languages, but say the same things.Most of the time boys fall in love with girls, and vise versa, but not always. Be curious. Ask questions. Good scientists ask questions. They don&rsquo;t always get answers.Do what you like doing, help other people do what they like doing.Some day, when their brains are nearly fully formed, they will hear a story about how one group of people discriminated against another. They will comprehend the history, and they will be able to empathize with the story in the abstract, but they won&rsquo;t really understand. They will realize that they never understood, and now, having grown and experienced the world, the will know that they don&rsquo;t have the tools to understand. I hope, that like me, they see it as a gift.#1ReasonToBe So that my sons grow up never knowing the difference.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI recently played The Room. My son is currently obsessed with it. On its face it seems to be a puzzle game, but as I played with it, I realized that it was actually something quite different. It's a discovery game. The setup is this. There is a finely crafted safe sitting in an otherwise empty room. Sitting on top of the safe is a note giving you a bit of a narrative push. &nbsp;You're off. You work various ornate mechanisms to obtain access to the safe. Once inside, you reveal even more ornate mechanisms. This pattern continues until you begin to question the internal volume of the original safe. New stuff just keeps popping out of these contraptions. Clearly there are some tardis-like shenanigans going on here.What struck me as interesting while playing it was that there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any actual puzzles in this &ldquo;puzzle&rdquo; game. Nothing makes you think very hard, or reason out a solution to a problem. The methods of opening, cranking, or manipulating each of the devices are handed to you. If you manage to get hung up for more than a few seconds on any device, the games hint system will just flat out tell you what to do next. The game succeeds or fails based only on discovery. It got me thinking about a lot of other games or game systems that use discovery to keep you playing. I did what I usually do when something like this strikes me, I combed the internet for articles written by smarter people than me. Turns out that studying the effects of novelty (novelty seems to be the commonly accepted term) on brain chemistry is pretty popular. Novelty, or discovery, drives our dopamine production in a big way. Novelty seeking behaviors, and maybe full on novelty addiction, seems to be hardwired into us. If I had to guess, I would think that novelty addiction doesn&rsquo;t come as a surprise to anyone reading this. You are, after all, reading this on the internet, which is, more or less, a novelty factory. The word addiction brings up a lot of negative connotations. I suppose you could say that people are addicted to conversation and social interaction, since we don&rsquo;t actually require them to survive, but most of us would suffer from severe mental and physical withdrawal if they were taken from us. Novelty, it seems, is of similar importance. Our brains reward us for doing things that are good for us, like eating, by producing dopamine. You know what else causes our brain to produce dopamine? Discovering new things. Novelty. I&rsquo;ll extrapolate a bit. Learning new things makes us happy. So here we have a game, that challenges the player in no real way, and yet, is compulsive as hell. There are a lot of other games that incorporate discovery as one of it&rsquo;s systems. Usually, games will oscillate between a discovery phase, early exploration in civ for example, and a strategy phase, like dealing with your cities in civ. The Room does away with any other phases and focuses only on discovery, or novelty. And it works. So what did I learn? I&rsquo;m not exactly sure. Investigation is ongoing, but I do know that I will be considering discovery as game mechanic from now on. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\t Real quick one this week.&nbsp;I did some work on the shaders. They were a bit cryptic, with exposed floats for tuning. I cleaned all that up, and got rid of a bunch of prototype nonsense. The render cycle went from 0.4-0.6 milliseconds to 0.2-0.4 milliseconds, so that&rsquo;s good, I suppose. Looks better too. I still need to profile the changes on mobile hardware, but the results should be similar.&nbsp;I started on a sort of switchboard that will let us control the color and lighting in a more global way, probably based on tags.&nbsp;The first pass on the Hero character and some of the inventory objects is done, and now I&rsquo;m getting them all game ready.&nbsp; \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Star Control 2We sit, perched forward, on wooden kitchen chairs. Moonlight slips between the vertical blinds behind us. Paired with the phosphor glow of my 15 inch monitor, it is just enough light to read by. Shawn has two maps of laid out in front of him. &nbsp;One is printed in bright, rich colour on glossy poster paper. The other is assembled from smaller black and white photocopies, scotch taped across the seams. Side by side, they span a good 3 or 4 feet of dining room table. The computer usually sits on a desk out in the shop. On other nights, we would be out there. The shop sits about 100 meters across the yard. The faint smell of gasoline and diesel exhaust permeates everything out there, but that never stopped us from spending hours at a stretch playing games and laughing at our own dumb jokes. Earlier, we disassembled the computer, carried all it&rsquo;s components from the shop to the house and reassembled it. The case is constructed of thick sheet steel. We consider, for a while, that 286 computer cases were probably punched in single pieces from the hulls of decommissioned battleships. It makes moving the computer, even a few feet, enough of an inconvenience that we don&rsquo;t do it often. It also means that it will likely grow roots in any new location. I&rsquo;ll be told, in a day or two, to pack up the computer and carry it back to the shop. That&rsquo;s fine. This weekend, we need to play. The computer is set up on the large, heavy, dining room table. Ghosts of paint jobs past are still embedded in it&rsquo;s deeper recesses. The table plays host to many items and activities, but only on holidays is it used for dining. We have cleared the sewing supplies, mail, and childrens hockey equipment, from one quarter of the table to set up. There is room enough for two stations. Over the span of 12 or so hours, we take turns manning each. The plan is to play for a few hours then crash on the floor for the night. We&rsquo;ll pick up the game early in the morning, before we are ejected out into the daylight to &ldquo;go ride bikes or something&rdquo;. &nbsp;Right now, Shawn is going over the maps. He checks the glossy poster against the blue, red, and yellow splotches on the screen, and marks any differences on the photocopies. The narrow slice of our galaxy represented on the map would be unrecognizable to an astronomer, but by now, a few hours in, we know it well. We have added notation for hyperspace and quasispace to the photocopy. Navigating these extra dimensions is old hat. He plots a course, from star to star, around Ur-Quan territory and I operate the keys to pilot us there. If we turned around to look out the picture window behind us, we would see actual stars in the actual sky. The picture window faces east. Sunlight skates across flat prairie. It scatters through the trees at the far end of the yard past the shop, and paints the dining room a dull gold. We never did crash on the floor.I&rsquo;ve seen the sun set, and rise many times before and since. I&rsquo;ve looked at the bare night sky, stretching out in a perfect dome of sharp contrast black and white. The stars on that map, the night sky on that screen, stands with equal strength in my memory to any sky I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Because I shared it with my friend.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\t       A few months ago I ordered, by rough estimate, a cup and a half of dice. A few of the standard cube shaped, 6 sided variety, but more importantly, there were 4, 8, 10, 12, and 20 sided dice in there. I know that it&rsquo;s difficult to imagine a nerd like myself would not already have a hoard of the things. For some reason, while I had gone through life gathering a regal crust of nerdy detritus, half remembered game systems, decades old electronics, comic books, and toys, polyhedral dice never formed part of that concretion. I wasn&rsquo;t about to let that grim fate befall my children. Their nerdiness is assured. I write this here, so that when the time comes, they will know exactly when and where the blame lies.Around the same time I purchased the dice I also purchased RPGKids. We played through a few simple adventures, but I very quickly started modifying the rules and tuning it to their particular brand of flagging interest. I built all the adventures out of lego and used the small lego game pieces to represent our characters. At first it was them vs. the world, or them vs me as DM. While they liked the adventure elements, adding a certain amount of structure kept them much more interested in the game than just running a free wheeling storytelling session. Anything that put them in direct competition with each other was a no go. It was cooperative or nothing. Children under 5 are not known for grace in defeat. When I started working on a new adventure for them, I decided to create something that would be entirely cooperative, where there is no DM. What we ended up playing was much more of a board game, with many elements lifted directly from FTL, or really any space ship game. This is how we played it, but I&rsquo;ve been adjusting and tuning the game from the first turn. If you come up with any good rule variations, let me know.          Space PiratesAttention Astronauts! This is the ship computer speaking! I am waking you from cryo-sleep to attend to an emergency situation! Space pirates are attacking this ship. We are caught it in a tractor beam and you will need to destroy the 3 pirate ships before they can steal all of our power cells, leaving us adrift in space. Good Luck!The blue area is your ship and the red is the pirate ship. The white lego bricks between rooms, are doors. We've taken out the doors where the pirates have broken them down. The pirates are in grey and the astronauts are blue, red, white, and black. The counters on the left, outside of the ship, are where we keep track of shields and player health. In the upper right of the game board is the pirate ship status. This pirate ship is one shot away from an explosion. The pirate in the lower left corner of the ship (the medical bay) has stolen an energy cell and is making a run for it. I have put one empty room between each room with a console to allow for a bit more planning. The room at the stern of the ship is the power cell storage room. Feel free to build your ship to your own specs.ActionsAll actions take one turn. You can decide together what an action is.&nbsp;Move from one room to another. The doors have force fields on them that are coded to the astronauts. Any player can pass through any door, but pirates will have to break the doors before they can pass through them. Attack PirateRun a consoleRepair a broken doorPick up a power cellInstall a power cellRecharge personal shields 1 unitHeal up 1 unitConsolesconsoles can be operated by any player, but they need a power cell installed to work. If a pirate has stolen the power cell you will either have to retrieve it, or get another one from storage. Pilot consoleShake the ship. If you are successful the pirates docking bridge will break and they will have to repair it before they can board your ship. Roll any die, over half succeeds, under half fails. Weapons consoleFire on the pirate ship. If you are successful the pirate ship shield will be damaged. If the shield is down you will damage the ship. Roll any die, over half succeeds, under half fails.Shield recharge consoleRecharges one level of personal shields to a player in the room.*make the game harder by requiring one player to run the console for the one being healed.Medical consoleRecharges one level of health to a player in the room.*make the game harder by requiring one player to run the console for the one being recharged.Power Management consoleBoost available power to the other consoles. Weapons console can fire twice per turn. Pilot console can shake twice per turn. Shield and Medical consoles can recover two points the player in that room per turn. *make the game harder by providing the boost to only one console at a time. The players will have to choose what console gets boosted for that turn.Docking BridgeThe docking bridge has 3 sections. At the start of the game the first pirate ship has it&rsquo;s bridge fully extended and the pirates are leaving their ship to attack your airlock. If you damage the bridge by shaking the ship at the Pilot console, the pirate ship can repair one section per turn. After a pirate ship is destroyed, the next pirate ship will need to fully deploy a docking bridge before more pirates can board your ship. The entire bridge counts as one room.&nbsp;We only had the pirate ship dock from one side, but I had originally intended that the pirates could dock from either side and you would roll a die to determine which side you are being&nbsp;boarded&nbsp;from. I will rebuild the board to allow for that next time we play.&nbsp;Taking TurnsPlayers take their turn first. You are working together so you should talk about coordinating your movements and actions. If a player spends their turn using the power management console other players receive the benefit during that turn. This is more important if you are using the modifications that make the game harder. pirates go second and all deployed pirates, likewise, take their turn at the same time. All pirates choose their targets first and then attack. If an astronaut is defeated during an attack, but another pirate also has that astronaut targeted, the second pirate will attack nothing, wasting their turn. Space PiratesThe space pirates only want to steal the power cells on your ship and carry them back to their ship. They will fight any astronauts they encounter, and they never, ever retreat from a fight. The only time they backtrack, is when they are carrying a power cell. If there are two astronauts in a room, the pirates will always attack the one that has lowered shields or injuries first. They aren&rsquo;t really interested in chasing down injured astronauts though, they are there for the power cells. If they get the power cell back to the pirate ship, it is lost. 1 pirate can leave the pirate ship at a time. We played with only 4 pirates active at a time. If a pirate is defeated they return to the pirate ship and can step onto the docking bridge during the next turn. Whenever the pirates came to a decision point, we would talk over what we thought the space pirates would do, and I would usually set up some sort of binary choice. Would they walk through a broken door or try to break down another door? Would they attack this player or this player? Then we would roll one die and just do a high-low to see what the pirate chose to do. If there was a three way decision, like one pirate choosing from 3 equally powered astronauts we would just roll a twelve sided die and split the decision between 1-4, 5-8, 9-12.CombatCombat with the space pirates is handled by opposing dice rolls. If the attacker rolls higher they win and damage the defender, if the defender rolls higher they defend and no damage is taken. A tie goes to the defender. &nbsp;We played with each pirate only having one unit of health. That turned out to be too easy, so we added one unit of shield to each pirate.&nbsp;*Kid friendly modification. If an astronaut is defeated they are not out of the game. they are instantly transported to the Medical bay and will need to recharge to full health before they can move again. They are in cryogenic stasis and pirates won&rsquo;t bother them. **Kid bonus. You get to teach your kid words like cryogenic, and stasis. WinningYou win When you repel three pirate ships and escape with some power cells.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI don&rsquo;t think that writers block (or artists / designers / creators block) is a fear of the blank page or canvas. I think a creator gets &ldquo;blocked&rdquo; because they haven&rsquo;t adequately defined the problem they are trying to solve.I&rsquo;m sure that not everyone thinks, or works like this. I&rsquo;m sure that some people prefer to intuit creative expression, but my brain just doesn&rsquo;t work like that. Art needs to be equal parts feeling and mechanics for me to create something successful. It&rsquo;s probably why I gravitate to design work that has a large technical component to it. Like games.Here is a quick breakdown of how I went about defining one particular design problem. When I first started on this game I had almost no idea what it would look like. It just didn&rsquo;t seem important. The mechanics of how you would move items around the screen was a more interesting and immediate problem. Games, even experiential art games like Proteus, are more about mechanics than design. Proteus is about navigating, and poking at, an environment. The aesthetics could have gone off in pretty much any direction, but movement and exploration are the core of that design. Establish that core and you have taken a step toward defining your design problem.                                In our case, we have a game that is played from a typical puzzle game perspective. The camera is locked in one position and adding too much perspective, or changing perspective, will just make the game more difficult to play. So there is another step toward defining the design problem.&nbsp;                               We wanted some representation of progress in the game, how far have you gone in a level or challenge, and how far away is the next challenge. There is already a game vocabulary for that. It is sometimes described as &ldquo;move right and conquer&rdquo;. The player character typically starts on the left side of the screen and either moves to the right of the screen, or just continuously moves right as the world moves past them heading left. As a visual shorthand for progress this construct works very well, and it is easy for non-gamers to pick up, so that further defines the design of the game.&nbsp;The most important elements of the game should take up the majority of the screen space. Our game is also being simultaneously designed for pc and mobile devices, so the physical limitation of touch devices has to come into play. Elements that can be touched need to be a certain size or they just won&rsquo;t work. This pushes the progress area up into a small portion of the screen. The hero character and the enemies will need to fit in this small area, so that means that fine details in the character textures just won&rsquo;t be visible. Large, high contrast details on the characters becomes a requirement. While trying to develop a presentation that meets these requirements, but is still visually interesting, I realized that there were still a lot of directions I could go in. I made a few false starts and tried out some ideas that just didn&rsquo;t work out, because I still had not really defined the problem.&nbsp;At first I tried creating detailed 3D models, thinking that we might use them in long shots and closeups. Closeups didn&rsquo;t really feel like they would help the game at all, so we could do away with those. Then I thought that flat, cut out style design would give us the contrast we needed. They would, but the character animation would be very limited. I settled on low to medium detail 3D models with high contrast, monochromatic textures. While the surface details of small objects wouldn&rsquo;t be visible, animation can read well at a very small scale, so having a character that was easy to animate was still very important.                                                            Memory limitations are always a consideration on mobile platforms. One of the benefits of going with monochromatic textures is that they are highly compressible. Also, since a typical image file is actually made up of 3 (4 if you count the alpha channel) monochromatic channels that are combined into a single colour image, we can pack 3 times as much information into the same amount of memory space.&nbsp;As I further and further define the problem, or problems I&rsquo;m trying to solve with this design, the easier and more obvious the solutions get. Now it could be possible that I need to go back and rethink the problem, or solve it in a different way. I could get partway into a design solution, only to find I&rsquo;m not really solving the problem at all. As long as I keep narrowing in on the problem, further defining and refining it, each blank page is just one in a long line of blank pages that are filled, and then abandoned. Each one is just another opportunity to solve a problem.&nbsp;And here is a video of me painting a texture in Sculptris.  \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tGames are enjoying a golden age. The first generation that never knew a world without video games is well into bringing up the first generation that will never know a world without the internet. Games and gameplay are not only ubiquitous, they are shared and shareable experiences. The media that promotes, comments on, and criticizes games is in the midst of an overhaul and only a small handful of &ldquo;enthusiast press&rdquo; seem to be ready, or willing to keep pace. Maybe it&rsquo;s time to be done with the game review.I have had a subscription to PC Gamer since the third issue. That&rsquo;s the american version. I purchased, at the newsstand, several issues of PC Gamer UK before that. I would sporadically pick up issues of CGW, Gamepro, and the like, but I only had subscriptions to a few other magazines. NextGen, Play, Polygon, and Game Developer all got the subscription nod. The only ones that still exist are PC Gamer and Game Developer. After almost two decades, I won&rsquo;t be renewing my subscription to PC Gamer, and the reason is game reviews.Not every medium requires interaction. Interaction is how video games work. Interaction is how much of the internet works. That's &nbsp;sort of their jam. Magazines are are not interactive. Magazines are archival. As a medium, print has one great strength. It lasts. This blog, along with much of the internet, could blink out of existence in a nanosecond. Any time and effort put in could be just flat out gone. If a copy of a 1912 Ohio newspaper exists, what is printed on it, has and will remain unchanged for as long as anyone cares to store it in a cool, dry, drawer somewhere. The same factors that make the internet so fragile, make it instantly and radically mutable. Journalism on the internet, can be interactive. Journalism in print, just isn&rsquo;t.Reviews are a naturally transient thing. Normally, you read a review sometime around the release of some other piece of media. A piece of media you find considerably more important and interesting than the review you are reading. You read it for one of two reasons. You want to know if someone else thinks that thing that you are interested in is worth your time, or you already know and you want to see if that other person agrees with you. Either way, the review itself is not of much value to you, and you are done with it almost immediately after reading. Most people are done with it after reading the number at the bottom of the page. For an interactive medium like video games, that can change and evolve over time, that change and evolve even as you play them, the speed and malleability of the internet is perfectly suited. Storing reviews in a permanent medium like a print magazine, is misunderstanding the medium. Reviews are not criticism. In a review, someone is offering up a yea or nay judgement, usually accompanied by some qualifiers and considerations. Criticism is the examination of a cultural artifact. Criticism of a game could weigh it's comparative strengths and weaknesses, but it also could be an in depth study of some aspect of the game, and how it relates to, history, art, biomechanics, psychology, sociology, or really anything in the length and breadth of human experience. Which of these two seems more suited for an archival medium?The second problem with most reviews is that games are experiences, not performance. Your experience of a game will probably be much different from my experience. I&rsquo;ve seen people compare writing about games to travel journalism, which really makes a lot of sense. Describing your experience through a game rather than describing the nuts and bolts seems to be closer to the spirit of the medium. I can&rsquo;t remember a time that I read the sports page and saw a blow by blow breakdown of how the sport of Hockey is played. That is what I am treated to month after month in the pages of PC Gamer. Now that a game reviewer can put up a two minute youtube clip breaking down what is good and bad about a game, then move on to writing a more detailed and investigative piece on why that game matters, doesn&rsquo;t that seem like a better use of their time and talent? Doesn&rsquo;t a well thought out argument on the refresh of the Lara Croft character, and why she does or does not advance the cause of feminism in the games seem like a better use of archival media than a &ldquo;back of the box&rdquo; list of the weapons? As navel gazing as it can be, I think the press that reports on games, owes it to the medium. I know they feel a respect for games as an art form, and a part of our cultural fabric, maybe it&rsquo;s time to treat them that way. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tMy Neighbour Totoro is one of my favorite movies. It's probably in my top five, if I cared to order the movies I love in that way.I don't. There are just too many. Do I rank them by times watched? First by genre, then by quality? By what they make me feel? Nah. I like a lot of movies for a lot of different reasons and any sort of ranking system would pivot on some other criteria. What movies top the list would depend greatly upon that other criteria. I love My Neighbour Totoro because it is quiet. Quiet, probably doesn&rsquo;t fully cover it. It&rsquo;s not really the decibel level of the movie. There is a pervading gentleness to My Neighbour Totoro. While there are scenes of danger and adventure, there is no conflict that needs resolution. The two main characters, young sisters, quarrel and bicker, but there is no implied breakdown of their relationship. Their mother&rsquo;s, seemingly chronic, illness drapes the entire film in a melancholy, but the family&rsquo;s love for eachother is never tested. They hold steady from the first scene until the last. There is very little in the way of plot. There are no twists. Dialogue is sparse, simple, and without subtext. It&rsquo;s all very subtle, beautiful, gentle and quiet. When it was released, My Neighbour Totoro ran on a double bill with Grave of the Fireflies. Grave of the Fireflies shares most of the qualities of Totoro. Very simple plot, simple characters, simple dialogue, simple quiet sounds. I would even say that it is very gentle, at least in the telling of it&rsquo;s simple story. While Totoro is enchanting and wonderful, Fireflies is the saddest movie ever made. That isn&rsquo;t hyperbole. I&rsquo;ve checked. There certainly are more disturbing movies, and maybe more tragic, but there are none sadder. I think that it is an amazing movie, well worth your time, but I&rsquo;ll offer fair warning. Once again,Grave of the Fireflies is the most heartbreakingly sad movie ever made. As I think my way through the entire Studio Ghibli library, I can hear that theme repeated time and again. Arrietty&rsquo;s first borrowing is played out slowly and deliberately. A scene that could be played for tension, is instead, very simple. Every sound is crisp and clear, but the scene is mostly quiet. There is a thoughtful quality to many Studio Ghibli films, but when they just turn down the music and highlight the simple clean sounds of footsteps, leaves rustling, water flowing, they do it like no one else. I started writing this with a point in mind, about how films have figured out the use of sound in ways that games haven&rsquo;t, but now I see that really isn&rsquo;t fair. It&rsquo;s not just games. Very few films, and filmmakers, have the level of mastery over soft quiet sound, soft easy pacing, and soft gentle storytelling, that Studio Ghibli does. With well over a century of films to reference, that subtle quality still eludes most filmmakers. Of course, not all films need that level of subtlety. The standard summer blockbuster, would probably not be strengthened by gentle, poetic sound design. Games, it seems, is a medium of blockbusters. You can point to the beautiful audio work of Team ICO or thatgamecompany, but that&rsquo;s about it. Everyone else is in the business of making blockbusters, with blockbuster sound. When anyone goes for a &ldquo;Ghibli style&rdquo; in a game, they always, always mean the art style. That&rsquo;s nice and all, but I think, just once or twice, I&rsquo;d like them to be talking about how their game will sound. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThis week I was cleaning up some models, making a couple new models, and doing a UV unwrap on this character.&nbsp;      That weird looking pelt in the bottom right is the UV layout   There are about seven thousand tutorials on UV unwrapping available one google search away. I don&rsquo;t think it would be worth your time if I did another one. If you ask me in person I will gladly walk you through the process in my own inimitable monotone fashion. You will probably fall asleep before we get to seam placement. So here is a quick, high level overview of UV coordinates and UV unwrapping. If you are at all familiar with 3D modelling and UV layout, this will be pretty boring for you. Feel free to leave now, and I&rsquo;ll see you back here next week. Also you could just jump to the bottom where I explain why none of this will matter soon.A 3D model is just a collection of points in space. For this character, a little over 1300 of them. They all have 3 coordinates that describe where they sit in space relative to some arbitrary zero point, or origin. You have x position (Horizontal), y position (Vertical), and z position (Depth). Some folks like to swap the y and the z, since z axis rising up perpendicular to the plane of the earth is how it&rsquo;s usually done in aviation. Unless you&rsquo;re some sort of heathen, x sits on the horizontal where it belongs. Whatever orientation you go with you put three numbers in the x, y, and z slots for each point. From any 3 points in space you can create a triangle. Making a 3D model is really just managing these triangles. Those 1300 form the corners of 2600 triangles. You move them around, add and subtract them, until it looks like whatever you are making. Sort of like Michelangelo freeing the angel from the rock, but in reverse. And with at least twice as much computer power. So what is a UV then? Well after you line up all those triangles into something recognizable, you might want to paint it. Those points and triangles aren&rsquo;t really anything. They are groups of numbers in a computer. Kinda tough to paint on math. But what you can do is take all those points and triangles, cut them apart and lay them out flat. You know when you get a paper model in a book or on a cereal box or something? You have to cut it out and then fold the paper so the edges come together to make some sort of three dimensional shape. Laying out UV coordinates is the opposite of that. You take this perfectly good model, mark the seams where you want it to come apart and then spread all the pieces out flat. You arrange the model pieces in a totally separate set of coordinates. The model sits in xyz space and this new flattened version of it sits in UVW space. UVW - xyz... yep, clever as it sounds. Now that you have everything laid out flat, and organized you can create a texture, or image, that is also flat. The points on the UV coordinate system will match up with their corresponding points in xyz space. The texture will stick to the same places on the model as they do on the UV layout. You might say, &ldquo;hey wait, you said UVW. What&rsquo;s the W for?&rdquo;. Just like the xyz coordinates the UVW system also has a depth element to it. It lets you do fancy stuff, like fake reflections and procedural volume textures. Probably nothing you need to worry too much about. UV unwrapping is one of those tedious, but vital steps in setting up a model. There are a lot of tools that can help you speed up the process, but you will have to do it, and it probably will suck at least a little. It&rsquo;s all right though, we probably won&rsquo;t be doing it for much longer. There are a few new tools that will automatically generate UV coordinated and pack them in ways that are not very photoshop friendly. While you probably couldn&rsquo;t make heads or tails of these image maps, they are really not meant to be viewed in 2D. They are for painting 3D models in 3D applications, for 3D applications. There are a few issues yet, when dealing with real time environments like game engines, but they are already very common tools at use in CGI production and animation studios. It&rsquo;s really just a matter of time before the tools and the pipelines make their way into game development. When that happens, you probably won&rsquo;t have to deal with UV maps again. I think I will be just fine with that. \t\t"

I&rsquo;m only now coming to grips with the rigging and animation systems in blender, so I opted instead to use a bunch of primitives and some character models culled from the Unity asset store. I think the test still gets the look across. Here's four minutes of me twiddling knobs.    This is a video clip of me playing with the shader I created for the game. The scene has no lights. All the effects are controlled by a couple of sliders hooked to range variables, some colors, and one texture. For this test scene I&rsquo;m only using one material, but setting up multiple materials for all the objects is pretty easy. The only extra bit of management that we will have to build is a sort of lighting board control system, so that different layers, and objects in the scene can be controlled as groups, rather than having to tune them all one at a time. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Encounter!I played Encounter on an Atari 800 computer. I played it a lot. It would be 10 years before Id software would recapture,with Wolfenstein 3D and Doom, the fluid control, speed and heart pounding tension of Encounter. Paul Woakes, seemingly alone, created what is probably the original first person shooter experience. There are certainly first person games that came before Encounter, and it would be easy to claim that Encounter is a clone of BattleZone. Where BattleZone is ponderous and methodical, Encounter plays more like the ancestor of Serious Sam. At least fifty percent of the time you will be backpedaling at breakneck speed away from a charging enemy. Attempting to lead targets is made more difficult due to their erratic, relentless behaviour. The action quickly becomes teeth grindingly intense when you realise that you just backed into one of the, ever present, pillars. You have milliseconds to dislodge yourself and escape. You probably won&rsquo;t. Your game will end with a deafening blast of digital static.That is the most striking and enduring element of Encounter!. The sound. While the small variety of diamond, circle, and square shapes in the game don&rsquo;t really drive fear into our hearts anymore, the sounds still do. There is an odd sort of mystery to Encounter. While the rising tone of the kamikaze enemy screaming toward you still holds up, it is the foreboding growl of the level end portal that sticks in my head. A black square spreads it&rsquo;s maw in front of you, like a rip in space. The game doesn&rsquo;t reward you for completing a level, it dares you to advance. Even moving from one level to the next is an arduous task, where you have to navigate a barrage of obstacles just to be unceremoniously dumped out of another portal, into god knows where. The ominous and unsettling sound is ever present.Go find an emulator, since 8 bit Atari computers are probably hard to come by, and try out Encounter!.  \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBlenderThe first 3D animation program I learned to use was Truespace 3D in the mid 90's. I would later go on to use, autocad, power animator, maya, and 3DSMax. The list of peripheral modellers, raster art programs, vector art programs, video editors, video compositors, design programs, cad/cam programs, and programming languages I've used sits about nipple deep. This is just stuff I&rsquo;ve used to do work, mind you. The junk I get up to for fun is an equally goofy pile. Software tools in equine choking quantities. Blender is a bit of a conundrum. I have very easily cast off Photoshop and Illustrator, replacing them with free and cheap tools that do all the same things. I can go back to them, like putting on a pair of comfortable old pants from the back of the closet, but I never feel the need to. Not using Maya to animate is like losing an arm. Or at least losing a few hotkey fingers. I&rsquo;ve spent more than a decade using Maya, and I&rsquo;ve grown a bit complacent. Sure I&rsquo;ve used other programs for this and that. I even had to change entirely to Max for a while, but I could always slip back into Maya. I think it&rsquo;s time to switch to Blender. There has been a copy of Blender on my computer since the NaN days. I would fire it up, update to the latest version, and fiddle around until I got annoyed and close it down again. I could always see promise in the program, but the interface was really terrible. I would hunt around on different forums, read or watch some tutorials, and still the interface was really terrible. When anyone would comment on how user ignorant the interface was, how it was like jabbing a hot poker at anyone with any familiarity with 3D modelling software, there was a blind uproar of zealotry from the faithful. The tacit adherence to being different, for the sake of being different, was off putting. I could dive into XSI or Modo and feel fairly comfortable in a few hours. Not so with blender. I figured, as long as they didn&rsquo;t change their interface to be more welcoming and flexible, Blender would remain an odd curiosity. Well a couple of versions ago, there was a major overhaul of the entire interface. I started it up and almost instantly everything felt more comfortable and useable. I could manipulate models and tweak verts, apply and adjust materials. Tools were where I expected them to be. More than that, everything was user configurable. It was everything I wanted from the program. I still did not switch. Truth is, that sometimes it's hard to learn new things. Especially when the old things are working just fine. I didn't switch to Blender because I didn't feel the need. There was no incentive to push myself out of the Maya comfort zone. The latest version of Maya seems great, like always, but I think I'll be dedicating my time to learning Blender. There is a change coming. The days of software that costs tens of thousands of dollars are pretty much done. The days of software that costs over a thousand dollars are numbered. Sure, there are a lot of large corporations shackled to expensive legacy software, but the the cost to stick with the old is beginning to outweigh the cost of switching. Open source, or inexpensive alternatives are increasing in quality and quantity rapidly. Tools that can't be had cheaply, or for free, are often available through subscription and royalty licences. I think that programs like blender, lightworks, gimp, and unity are paddling well out ahead right now, and they will be the first to ride that wave. It's not just that I am cheap (I am). I think that autodesk, and to a lesser extent, Adobe are not ready for this change. They have been beaten on price, and you only have to do a quick sided by side comparison with these other tools to see that it won&rsquo;t be long before they are matched, or beaten on quality. Photoshop and Maya might be industry standards, but so was Lotus Notes. Creativity software serves an industry with a product cycle from a few weeks to a few years. It wouldn&rsquo;t take much of an exodus for something new to become the industry standard. Probably, I&rsquo;m only justifying to myself why I would go through the annoyance and headaches of learning a new animation program, but I really do think the high ticket price software model is doomed. If Maya was suddenly available for a sub $200 yearly subscription, I would likely run back in an instant. For now though, it&rsquo;s Blender for me. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThere are a lot of examples of morality systems in games. Games where there is a light or dark, good or bad choice. Often the choices are explicitly highlighted for you, and you will receive rewards based on how good or bad the game thinks you are acting. While this construct feels artificial and \"gamey\", I have a suspicion that most developers feel that is just the best, most transparent way to present that facet of their particular game experience. Presenting numbers to the player so that they know, when the numbers go up, they &ldquo;done good&rdquo;. Of course we accept it as just one of many game systems. Being a good guy or a bad guy in most games is no different than choosing a vehicle or sports team. This one has 15 more horsepower and that one is strong on defense. Minor tradeoffs, that when accounted for lead to exactly the same victories and defeats. It&rsquo;s just one of many variables to keep track of. In our lives, morality isn't binary, or a guideposts to a known end. Acting \"good\", or \"bad\" doesn't guarantee that good or bad things will happen to you. We learn that very, very young. We smile and try to pet the dog that nips at us, or we lie to an adult and escape punishment. The world doesn't react to us based on our intent. But, over time, people do. People will treat us differently, based on the way we have acted in the past. Of course there are outliers and sometimes people are just dicks for no reason, but the majority of people will adapt their behaviour to deal with ours, as we do with them. Usually in a complementary way. When a person is nice to you, you will likely reciprocate. When a person is confrontational, you will likely avoid them until you can&rsquo;t and then, as before, reciprocate. When we think of morality in this way, peoples behaviour can break down into a few simple states. To people accustomed to solving problems that you can break down into a few simple states, like game developers, human behaviour, and human morality, has the makings of a good, solid game mechanic.The problem here is, we have no idea what other people are thinking or why they are thinking it.There is no omniscient arbiter of good or bad. Just people. Just a bunch of people, all thinking different things, for different reasons. Each one as inscrutable as the next. This is the sort of mire that great characters and great narrative are built on. If we could instantly suss out the motivations and intent of a character in a narrative, a character that isn&rsquo;t us or our avatar, what&rsquo;s left? That character, or possibly the whole construct, will start to feel artificial. Flimsy. Gamey. Lets say a companion character, who has followed the player for weeks in a game, gradually became more quiet and sullen, before leaving the group altogether. As a human being, I will be required by my biological and social programming to wonder what he was thinking, was it something I did, or was there something I could do to get them to come back. Or maybe I think about it and decide that it was that guy&rsquo;s problem, not mine, and our group is better off without him. Probably, I oscillate between the two, and that character's decision to leave eats at me for the next few hours. At least. This character leaving the group may not be a dynamic event arising from a complex simulation. It could be an authorial choice. There may not have been anything I could do, as a player, to prevent it. If this character lived in a novel or movie, it most certainly would be a predetermined choice. But I don&rsquo;t need to know that. I don&rsquo;t want to know that. The story is better for me not knowing. Not knowing the mind of these characters, is precisely what makes them characters. The problem with morality systems in most games, is not how the system is set up. It&rsquo;s not the calculations under the hood. It&rsquo;s the presentation. If the game system is silently keeping score of my triumphs and transgressions, the worst thing it could do to me is tell me. Just like a character seems more real if his motivations and intent are not transparent, the way the world reacts to the player should be left up to interpretation. What was it that made that character leave the group? Was it when I stole food from the camp rations? When I kicked his dog and seduced his mother? What did the game system consider morally wrong? I think I would rather not know. The story I create will be better for not knowing. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tA few years ago, when I made signs, I created a complicated measuring tool that could take the place of 7 or 8 other, large, unwieldy tools. It was cut out of one, fairly light piece of aluminum, and looked sort of like something a klingon Pope would carry lashed to a stick. No one outside of our shop ever saw that thing, and it&rsquo;s likely that few people ever will. I was happy with the result, not because it looked cool, I would argue that it did, but because it solved a problem. It was as clear an example of form following function as I&rsquo;ve ever come up with.During the recent Global Game Jam, the team I was working with came up with some very simple procedures for parting out our project so that everyone could work on it at the same time. It was a bit messy, but it worked. We simply had everyone working on separate parts, sound, art, levels, behaviours, code, etc. then we would bundle them up and import them all into one master project. Had we worked like this for a week or a month, we would likely have ran into some catastrophic errors. Had we worked on the game for any longer than 48 hours we would have started to refine the process. We would codify naming conventions and packaging procedures. We would move people into roles that played to their strengths. The form of the team and the way it worked would follow the function of developing the game. Adventure Caddie is fast approaching a state where codifying processes will become important. I was sort of hoping that, during this game jam, I would have to tackle some of those problems. From a purely selfish point of view, I think I got what I needed out of the experience. I think I have a pretty solid handle on how to deconstruct the game into packageable parts, and then reintegrate them cleanly.In a future post I&rsquo;ll go over, in more specifics, how we will deal with project and asset management on Adventure Caddie. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\t10000000, ideas, and open development When I played 10000000 two things went through my head. First, this game is brilliant. It is simple and accessible enough that my whole family could play it, but addictive enough that we kept coming back. My second thought was, \"dammit, he beat me to it\".&nbsp;I try not to treat ideas very preciously. If I come up with an idea that I think is good I would rather give it to someone who might use it than keep it to myself to gather some sort of glory down the line. That glory never comes, and I'm honestly not certain I would want it if it did. Sounds like a lot of hassle. Oh and then there is this. I know all my good ideas are stolen.&nbsp;My head is a labyrinthine mess of minutia and non sequiturs. Bits of old superhero comics, video games, tv shows, books, and, to a lesser extent, actual, useful facts all swim around In my thought soup playing free association with each other. Considering a development challenge will just as often lead me to thinking about 6 panels of a Wolverine from 1991, a videogame I played in a rink in Sylvan Lake, or some quick fix I had to pull on a car 15 years ago. All equally valid solutions to the problem as far as I'm concerned. Typically it is some artisanal blend of distantly recalled pop culture, and physical manufacturing, that solves most problems. Surpassing any skill I may have gained from toiling at many jobs, (That&rsquo;s a Fugitive reference. See. Still stealing ideas) I have a definite aptitude for combining seemingly disparate things to make new things.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not unique.&nbsp;I get the impression, mostly because people tell me, directly, in almost precisely these words, that a lot of creative people think in exactly the same way. There is a community of \"makers\" growing. They are a tribe of people connected almost solely by this affinity for combining ideas. The further afield the ideas that you are appropriating, and fusing, the better. I grew up on a farm, where being a &lsquo;maker&rsquo; is encoded at a genetic level. It&rsquo;s probably the same at most farms around the world. In fact a good portion of people who didn&rsquo;t grow up on a farm probably do the same thing. I&rsquo;ll broaden that out a bit more. Maybe it&rsquo;s a human trait, to want to combine different ideas to make new ideas. In any case, I&rsquo;m not unique.&nbsp;I thought &ldquo;dammit, he beat me to it&rdquo;. The it in question was a basic premise for a game. A protagonist, moving from left to right, &nbsp;that you don&rsquo;t directly control, but instead, help through an adventure, by manipulating a puzzle type game lower down on the screen. This one, run on sentence description could sum up Adventure Caddie. The loose design document that I started putting together was created in November of 2011, and the prototypes predate that, so I had been working on for quite a while by the time 10000000 launched on the app store. For a short time, I was gutted. The two games shared a lot, and Luca Redwood&rsquo;s game was so very good. People would certainly think I stole his ideas. Of course, this also meant something else. The core idea of the game worked. It was fun.To tell the truth there is only a very superficial similarity between the two games. Much in the way as say, Mario and Sonic are the same. What seems to have happened, as often happens, is that we both went to the well of ideas and pulled up a similar bucketful. While I don&rsquo;t know Luca Redwood, it does seem reasonable that we probably share many pop culture influences. He may have played Puzzle Fighter, puzzle quest, and lemmings. I felt these were sources worth stealing from, why wouldn&rsquo;t someone else.&nbsp;Now 10000000 exists in the world. Its a great thing too. Other people down the line will use that game and maybe something they learned while working on a tractor, or a fishing boat, to make the next great thing. Anything created carries the imprint of it&rsquo;s influences forward. Nothing is created influence free.As I continue to wrestle with this concept of more open development, it&rsquo;s a constant battle to resist the impulse to protect ideas as valuable commodities. Truth is, we all go to the same well for our ideas and the odds are pretty good that someone similar to me, or you, might come up with the same ideas. When many people, isolated from one another, come up with similar ideas, and then act on them, we are probably on the right track. There is no reason to be discouraged, at least not to the point that we stop making what we are making, when we see that something similar has already been done. The proof of concept is out of the way. It works, and it&rsquo;s fun. Now it&rsquo;s time to see what we can bring to it. What I can bring to it.If you have an IOS device, you should probably go get 10000000. It&rsquo;s great. Update: looks like 10000000 is now on Steam. so head over there if you want to play it on your computer.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tA little bit ago, my oldest son said he wanted to program something. While the thought of passing on my love of techno geekery had me overjoyed, I knew that there was no way he would stay focused long enough to really grasp loops or variables, or why they are important. At least not yet. It was almost 30 years ago that I first learned \"basic\" on a Timex Sinclair 1000.I pined over that computer. It sat on display atop a washing machine at the local appliance store / hobby shop. I&rsquo;m not sure if many other kids my age saw it as more than just some odd curiosity. A ruthlessly complex speak and spell, that could neither speak nor spell. I had probably crossed some line with the proprietor of the store, and rather than wipe my drool off the machine, my parents purchased it for me as a gift.          It came with 2K of ram, and a 16K ram pack that would occasionally fall out, resetting the machine. Programs to run on it were printed out in a couple of books with names like 70 games for the Timex/Sinclair 1000 and 1500. The first time my dad and I took a spin at typing in one of the games we had no Idea what any of these commands meant or did. We just took turns reading from the listing or blindly pressing characters on the membrane keyboard. Not understanding the weird, context sensitive keyboard layout, or that we had to press enter at the end of each line, we just punched everything in as if it were just one long line of text. Of course the program didn't run. Also, since the input buffer was full, each time we pressed a key the whole screen would redraw slowing everything to a crawl. Several hours later, we managed to get one simple game called Alley Driver working.&nbsp;Over the next year or two, I would type in all but the most daunting or dull of the programs in those books. many times. I would attempt to record some of them onto audio tape, &nbsp;usually rendering them irretrievable. Through sheer repetition, and some form of digital osmosis, I gradually learned what most of the basic commands meant and did. Tweaking those programs to do slightly different things became a more enjoyable hobby than actually playing the games. The games were all pretty terrible. I made many, many versions of Alley Driver.&nbsp;When I went to look for simple, kid friendly, programming environments for my son and I to play with, it was like backing up a dump truck. Where I had a few books and an inscrutable interface to deal with, we now have drag and drop, visual editors like Scratch, Lego Mindstorms, and Alice. Not only are these programming environments very easy to use and understand, but they teach much more relevant and complex concepts than good old basic ever did. Object oriented programming, loops, and recursion are all represented visually. And we all know what a picture is worth.&nbsp;My son is still not on board with deciphering the deeper concepts of programming, but when he is ready, I&rsquo;m pretty sure he will have an easier time of it than I did. There is no need for some bizarre comp-sci rosetta stone. Basic has been superseded by more abstracted, but also more easily understood, beginners programming languages. Actually, I take back the &ldquo;beginners&rdquo;.Aside from nostalgic curiosity, there is no longer a reason to cram a program down into 2K of ram. As computing power increases, so will the viability of using drag and drop, visual programming environments to create actual applications. Applications that people will buy, sell, and use. These aren&rsquo;t just tools that kids use until they graduate to a &ldquo;real&rdquo; programming language. Go download Alice or Scratch. They are not dissimilar to what &ldquo;real&rdquo; programmers will be using in the future.&nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tClosing out 2012, I figured it would be worth it to have a think about the year. Not really self reflection, I do enough of that, and it's pretty dull for anyone who isn't me. I think I'll just go over the one thing that struck me about games and the state of the game industry this year. I'll state it by way of prediction.&nbsp;It's downloads only from here on out. And that is sort of a big deal.This was the year that download games surpassed the entertainment value of the standard issue, go to a store and buy a game on a disc, game. Now it's pretty easy argument to say, of course I'm wrong, the most money making games of all time came out this year, and they came out of on a disc. But actual entertainment value? The money and time put in versus entertainment received? For all but the most entrenched of call of duty fans, this year went to the downloadable game. That goes triple if you played anything on a PC.There is the old contention that not enough Internet speed and bandwidth is available to make a download only business viable. That may have been true at the start of this console generation, 7 years ago, but that's not the case anymore. There are still a few minor benefits to buying a game deployed on some physical object, but there are ways to have both a brick and mortar store presence and be an all download games market on the same platform. I've stated before, if the physical media solution on Microsoft's next console isn't a usb port they have done something terribly wrong. For anybody who&rsquo;s been using the internet a while, you might be saying &ldquo;that&rsquo;s completely obvious&rdquo; or &ldquo;that happened a long time ago&rdquo;. Well yes, and no. Sure, we downloaded and played the add on for Wing Commander Prophecy in 1998, but we are really odd exceptions. Most of the world didn&rsquo;t even get close to that level of internet usage until sometime after facebook launched. A big chunk of the game industries target audience wasn&rsquo;t even born in 1998. Internet is as ubiquitous as telephone service now, for a lot of people it is telephone service, but that only started about 5 years ago. This year was the tipping point. 5 years from now, games on physical media will be as common as 8 track tapes. Why is this important at all? Time was, you could sell your game on a disk (floppy disk) in a ziplock bag, with hand written labels, and make a few bucks. The audience for your game depended on how far you could travel and how well you could pitch your game. The packaging and distribution of digital entertainment products advanced quite a lot from that point. It also cost a lot more money to package, distribute, and pitch those products. That money came from publishers, some went to stores, most went back to publishers, and a small trickle returned to developers. The new stores will be the boxes hooked up to the TV and the developers will be able to sell almost directly with or without a publishers help. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that all of a sudden developers will be rolling in filthy lucre. There are a lot of different roadblocks that come with digital distribution and the digital stores that facilitate it. But still, the variety of outlets where a developer can peddle wares is on the rise, and getting a game into one of these stores is fairly frictionless when compared to manufacturing cartridges, or discs, and sending them to be sold. Out of buildings. Personally, I can really only speak for the digital store route, since I&rsquo;ve never had to put something on a cartridge. By the sound of it, I didn&rsquo;t miss out on anything. The audience for your game now depends on how well you can pitch your game. The&nbsp;vehicle for your pitch,&nbsp;packaging, and distribution exists in their home. Maybe even in their hand. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Puzzle Uo Poko I&rsquo;ll just get this out of the way right off the top.         Whatever you do, do it to the full extent of the jam. If the perpetual hilarity of the of the warning screen was the only thing this game provided, it would be notable. Lucky for us this is also an excellent game. The match three to win formula was already pretty worn when this game came out. We had gone through matching shapes, matching creatures, matching colours, matching squares, matching cubes, and matching pharmaceuticals. So what does CAVE do to advance the matching puzzle genre? Take away all control options, save one. You pull down on the joystick, and then you let go. That is the totality of your influence on Uo Poko. Pull down. Let go. I won&rsquo;t describe the gameplay beyond that, because 12 seconds into this video you will understand all the complexity and nuance that Uo Poko has to offer.     Seriously, if that cats gleeful cheers don&rsquo;t make your heart happy, then you are dead inside.&nbsp;There is an amazing thing about Uo Poko. In the opening levels the game is taught to you so well, that when the guide that shows you where your bubble will land disappears, and you are left, unaccompanied, to make the shots yourself, you probably won&rsquo;t notice. You will likely make several shots, each one precisely on target, before you realize that you did it on your own. The timing required to make accurate shots is etched on your cerebellum, leaving the rest of your brain free to listen to that cat, and feel happy. There is only one kind of multiplayer on offer, and depending on who you play with, it is either a collaborative, back slapping, we&rsquo;re in this together, good time, or a hate field of free form griefing, and counteractivity. Both players are meant to take turns firing their bubbles into the same play area, working together to clear the screen. Often, you are able to fire your bubbles at the same time, resulting in a mid air collision. Since each missed shot advances the board upwards by one notch, a few of those can end a game right quick. Maybe you didn't mean to do it, maybe you did. I won't judge.Uo Poko is a great game, where you can do a lot, by doing almost nothing. You should play it to the full extent of the jam.&nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\t    This is my close approximation what Adventure Caddie will look like.   Have you ever had an epiphany?&nbsp;&ldquo;What sort of hyperbolic nonsense are you treating us to today, you ridiculous goof?&rdquo; you might ask. You would probably be right. I am a ridiculous goof, but I do have epiphanies from time to time. Usually while I&rsquo;m peeing. That isn&rsquo;t, exactly, an important bit of trivia. I&rsquo;m not sure if I was peeing when this particular epiphany struck me, but it is possible that my pants were down. If that put any unfortunate images in your head, that&rsquo;s on you. Everybody pees. Anyway. I have spent literally months working out how the game I&rsquo;ve been working on should look. I &nbsp;have been more concerned with how to make all the pieces work together, than really nailing down the aesthetic. Do these shaders work? Do they work on mobile? Is the fill rate too high? Do the models need to be rigged, or can I just use hierarchical animation? do they even need to be models? Should the animation be sprite based? When you start a game, the blank page analogy applies, but this blank page stretches out in 4 dimensions, and requires a 6 cylinder engine that you must also design and assemble. You don&rsquo;t just draw a nice picture and then add &lsquo;game&rsquo; to it. So I drew a picture, and now I have to add game to it. Luckily the game part is already well underway. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been working on the underpinnings of the artwork, while Rich Hudson has been working on the code. While doing this, very necessary technical work, I&rsquo;ve been systematically reducing and refining what I wanted the game to look like for months. The dark secret of art, is that it never comes out like you thought it would. No one imagines a picture and then, recreates exactly, that picture. You attempt an approximation and then push, pull, and refine from there. Typically, this process only comes to an end when you run out of time. When you work to a deadline, you do what you can in the time allotted and then hand it off, dissatisfied. The client, since they were not the ones doing the work, usually is satisfied, and might even say they &ldquo;like it&rdquo; or &ldquo;it&rsquo;s good&rdquo;. If you did your best, you know that you did your best, and move on. You have to be content with that. When you don&rsquo;t have a hard deadline, or you have a loose, self imposed deadline, you just have to ram into the problem as much as possible in the time you have. Sometimes, what everything should look like will become apparent quickly, and then you just do the same as you would under deadline. You attempt an approximation and then refine from there. Other times, like with this game, you might be more concerned with the function of the underlying systems than with the final look. I would never recommend waiting for an epiphany, since there really is no guarantee that you will have one. I go pee a lot, and honestly, epiphanies are rare. This time, though, I had an epiphany. That is to say, I worked on the problem long enough, and from enough angles, that the solution came to me, all at once, almost fully formed. As if it were obvious. Now I just do the same as always. Attempt an approximation. Refine. I&rsquo;ll know I&rsquo;m done when I run out of time. And now I know when I will run out of time.Adventure Caddie will launch in 2013.\t\t"

This week I was thinking about modelling a game character, so if that is what you showed up for you are in luck. If not you can watch this anyway.

    "content": "\t\t\t\tThe illusion of racingI really enjoy racing games. Racing has a built in drama and tension that requires nothing more than increasing speed and an opponent. The opponent is optional. Foot racing is likely the original \"game\", and endures, undiluted, based on that drama alone. Given a free moment, people will race anything. The feeling of mounting velocity, driving headlong toward the finish. Toward the goal, the next corner, the next target. It's a rush of energy and excitement that builds in the center of your chest and radiates outward. Racing is a feeling that is universally human.Artificial human characters, created to look and act realistically, are almost always hideous, dead eyed, monstrosities. What humans look like and how we move are so fundamental to us that any deviation from the norm is instantly noticeable. In a bad way. There is something in us that can identify any imperfection in human morphology and movement. Instantly. Most animated characters avoid the uncanny valley by simply sidestepping it. Animated characters do not look or move like real people. This is something that 1930's Disney animators called the illusion of life. The goal of the Disney animators was not to mimic reality, but to create something convincing. Attempting to recreate reality left characters feeling cold and lifeless. Oddly enough, they didn't seem real. Racing, and the physics of movement at increasing rates of speed, are similarly fundamental to us. Racing is susceptible to the uncanny valley. Most racing games avoid the uncanny valley by simply making the racing unrealistic. Mario Kart is fun, and it feels sort of like racing, because it is nothing at all like really racing. Mario Kart is more like the board game Sorry played at high speed. We can call it the illusion of racing. It's not real, but it feels convincing.&nbsp;Of course, there are simulations that attempt to model the real world as accurately as they possibly can. Tire compounds, road surface, engine torque over the entire power band. All of that is in there, but they model the physics of the world, not the racing. The best simulations put you up against real people operating their own fake vehicles. When they try to model the racing by fudging the rules for the AI, or even for you when you play against an AI opponent, it all falls apart. The rubber banding is apparent. The whole experience goes tumbling into the uncanny valley.&nbsp;Just as a man with a limp still registers as human, a race where one competitor outclasses the others, but competes within the same rules, plays out as real race. Adjusting the experience to try to make races close, or placing the player at a disadvantage off the starting line so they have to fight through the pack doesn&rsquo;t increase drama or tension. It feels wrong. Uncanny.&nbsp;Racing works as it is. It is built into us. There is no need to &ldquo;tune&rdquo; it to make the experience more exciting or dramatic. Put that work into the race courses, the setting of the competition, or improving the feeling of the simulation. Trust that simply racing will be, as it always has been, fun.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tBest Games - Magical Drop 3Every colour is sharp and vibrant. Staccato notes sing over a bouncing march. It sounds like joy.You play. Your moves are quick and precise. The tones rise with each consecutive match. 1. 2. 3. Your pace drops as you search for your next move. 1 quarter second to late. You miss. Not quick enough. You rearrange the board, making single matches looking, again, for an opening to line up a new combo. You see two reds beside three blues. Above them is a layer of green. You pull down a solitary red from the far side of the board and dash quickly back under the pair. 1. Don&rsquo;t wait for the chime! Move! You pull down the blues and instantly fling them back up. 2. You have bought a fraction of a second. The reds have faded from the board and you are already there pulling down a single green. Quickly, back to the blues. You toss the green back up, aiming to steamroll the still fading blues. 3. Don&rsquo;t wait for the green to collide. There is a gold, one step to the right. You twitch right and pull it down. As the greens fade you twitch back to the left and toss it back up through the sparkling mist. 4. You run out of moves. The other spheres are two or three moves away. It could be miles. The last, highest, tone fades. You restart the process of setting up the board, clearing a line here and there. Holding off the stomping, inevitable, march of the bubbles. Looking for an opportunity for five, or even six. Next time, you will be faster. Never fast enough. You will strategize to the point of clairvoyance. Never enough. It feels like joy.You play.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tQuiet Moments.The Walking Dead is the first game that has ever made me cry. Games, sports included, are typically full of gung ho bombast. There are moments of high energy, and deep strategy, but your motivation to attempt these tasks, is kept light. Games feed our power fantasy and escapist needs. Games are consequence free conflict. Precise management of time and space. The best games are usually honed to eliminate any extraneous elements, anything that could obstruct our fun. There is a very narrow emotional band being targeted by most games, somewhere between tension and adrenaline. Time and again they successfully hit that mark. When a game makes you feel something new, it's worth thinking about why. I think a case could be made for calling The Walking Dead interactive film, rather than a game, but screw that. I'm tossing it into the game pile. It resembles its ancestors, games like Sam &amp; Max or Full Throttle, but it has jettisoned a lot of the busy work of those games. Pixel hunts and puzzle solutions 7 steps deep are not to be found in The Walking Dead.Everything that makes up your basic adventure game is either pared down or abandoned. Each episode is only a couple of hours long. There is a single save slot and autosaves are frequent. Most dialogue choices are on a timer that forces you to think and act quickly. All of these design choices drive the player forward at a relentless pace. Nothing points to offering a broader emotional canvas than any other game. The dialog and characters are well written, but not more so than other games of this type, and certainly not as well as the best movies and television. So what is different about this game? There are two very significant advancements that Tell Tale has contributed to interactive storytelling. The first is the ability to do nothing. Most games wait for you to do anything that triggers its simulation to move forward. If you do nothing, the narrative will not advance. When the dialog choices appear on the screen in The Walking Dead one of the options is always to do or say nothing. Since the dialog system is on a timer, if you don't make a choice, doing or saying nothing becomes your choice. The other characters react as if you have said nothing and the narrative continues affected by that choice. Occasionally, just shutting up and watching the other characters deal with their own shit is a valid option. The narrative carries on without your input or your permission. This puts the player, accustomed to being at the helm of these stories, back on their heels a bit. Suddenly the choices presented to you have real, in the moment, weight. Do you instigate a fight, attempt to break it up, or stand back and watch it happen. You only have a moment to choose, and the game will likely autosave soon after this. You are in this moment and there are no takebacks. In the face of this pressure, inaction is always an option. You quickly gain acute insight into every secondary characters motivations. When those few seconds come, choosing the exact response, with just the right nuance you need to convey is critical. At least it feels critical. Your relationships with the other members of your group feel critical. Especially when you do nothing. On the opposite end of the tension spectrum, The Walking Dead provides several opportunities per episode to spend a long time performing an inconsequential task. These are quiet moments. Memorable ones are pushing a child on a swing and shovelling dirt. You could opt to bypass these moments and push on with the game. In the context of the narrative, these moments offer a small relief from the constant tension, while building the anticipation of oncoming tragedy. You know bad things are coming. The game has promised you that much. While it won&rsquo;t directly affect the story, every moment you spend on these tasks, is more time for you, the player, to think about what has happened and what is coming. The authors of The Walking Dead are using the players own experiences and thoughts to strengthen their story. Books and movies have been doing this forever, offering up a quiet moment for the audience process what they are watching or reading, filtering the story through the only thing we have, our own experiences. Games are about management of time and space. Quiet moments are not usually part of the vocabulary. Every member of an audience has likely experienced love, loss, tension, fear, anger and a spectrum of other emotions. Tell Tale has used those quiet moments to draw on the emotions of their audience as well as any author could. The only difference is, here, you are a participant. When narrative is added to a game it is tucked in alongside hyperkinetic play, and allowed no room to breath. Emotional story beats often feel forced, or they are mired in twitch action scenarios, never giving the player a chance to process what they have seen and heard. Worse, most games steal control from the player and present their emotional moments in a cut scene, almost physically distancing the player from what they are watching. Cut scenes undermine the main strength of the medium, interactivity. Where film is a &ldquo;show don&rsquo;t tell&rdquo; medium, games are a &ldquo;do don&rsquo;t show&rdquo; medium. A few other games have had some strong emotional moments. Bastion, Shadow of the Colossus, Bioshock, Journey, and the last few hours of Mass Effect 3 stand out as strong emotional storytelling. All of them worked best in their quiet moments, and rarely steal control from the player. They were able to shut up long enough for me to hear what they had to say.I had included a brief description of the few moments that I found particularly tear jerking, but I thought that was a bit spoilery for a game this new. If you are at all interested, I would say you should just go play it. It is short and cheap. I think it&rsquo;s well worth your time. If you have any other examples or moments from games that you found affecting, or if you just want to tell me I&rsquo;m a sissy, go ahead and put that in the comments. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\t WorkFlow&nbsp;Tweaking and refining a workflow is a huge part of any repetitive task. I used to work in sign shops, where I would make, you know, signs. A lot of them. When you do any sort of assembly line or manufacturing work, refining your workflow is fundamental. The first one of anything will take you a very long time to build, each subsequent unit will be faster and more efficient, until you hit some sort of equilibrium. The trouble with signs is that you will almost never create the same sign twice. If you manufacture bearings you will make millions of the exact same bearing. The function of a bearing requires it to be as close to identical to other bearings of the same type as possible. A slightly different bearing, is probably a bearing that won&rsquo;t work properly. Making 100 signs, in a run, all with slightly different design or copy, is the norm. Making ten thousand signs with a variety of dimensions, shapes, designs, and materials is what you can expect to do, if you take up making signs. Every time you pick up a work order, the sign you are making will be different. Making games is not like making bearings.&nbsp;   I am working on a game that is played in 2 dimensions, but operates within a 3d game engine, Unity. There are a lot of good reasons for making a game in a 3d engine, and once you come to grips with working in 3d space, not many down sides. There are some constraints though. I&rsquo;m much better versed in making the art for games, than how the computer processes that art, but, through doing some reading and some tests, this is how I understand it. The way the computer processes artwork in a 3d engine means that typical drawings and paintings are not dealt with very efficiently. Stacking a bunch of semi-transparent layers to build a scene similar to traditional animation, causes a computer a lot of distress. If you don&rsquo;t tell it otherwise, it will redraw the whole screen for each of those layers. The computer really likes solid objects, made of tightly defined triangles. It can parcel up all those discrete groups of triangles and process them into images on your screen very quickly. So I am making 2d art for a 2d game, but I&rsquo;m using triangles in 3d space. This requires that I figure out a decent work flow. I typically like to model 3d objects in maya or silo, but for this game I'm using photoshop. Photoshop is almost the worst tool you could use for 3d. I suppose a case could be made for Word being worse than photoshop for 3d, but still, not very good at 3d. It is really good at dealing with pixels, and more importantly for me, vector shapes. There are vector drawing programs that are better at dealing with vector art, but they typically suck at pixel, or raster, art. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that I could do similar work with Gimp, but vector art in gimp is a little trickier to work with. I&rsquo;m still refining it, and trying to automate as many of the tedious bits as I can, but this is the current workflow.I create shape layers in Photoshop filled with flat colours, adjusting the vector shapes until I have the object silhouette I want, for this game a sword, shield, or other medieval fantasy weapon. I can then go in and paint within that silhouette to add detail. Now I can output all the shape layers to svg vector art. I also save the raster image of the details I added to the silhouette as a png file. Then I take that svg and open it in blender to create a polygon mesh from the paths. I tried going through maya and silo, but neither worked very well. Blender does the conversion perfectly in one or two steps. That mesh can then be passed into Unity, have the png file applied to it as a texture, and set up to be put into the game.             Flat colour filled vector shape       vector curves imported into Blender          painted to add detail       and converted to polygon meshes         The other limitation, besides using triangle based geometry, is memory. I&rsquo;ll try to use as little of it as I can. Making one texture sheet for each asset would be a terrible waste of memory. Before I dump the assets out to the game I will create a texture sheet that has as many of the items as I can pack into one image. The fewer images used, the smaller the memory footprint. Outputting the vector art from these packed positions on the texture sheet, will also create an instant UV map, something you typically have to do after you model the geometry.&nbsp;So there you go. It&rsquo;s not a complex workflow, but it&rsquo;s a little unusual. Like making signs, there are some unique elements, but a lot of the workflow is similar enough to other things I&rsquo;ve done that I can be somewhat efficient. I managed to tune the operation slightly while I was writing this. As I create more items, I will find other areas of the process that can be optimized, automated, or just dumped. Of course, no matter how refined, work is still work, and it will take some time. I&rsquo;ll get back to it.&nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tSo right now I'm working on art for one game, while programming another, and thinking about yet another. Maybe I should focus more, or maybe I'm just running from project to project, without ever finishing anything. Those accusations would be true. I also think that it is a fairly common way that people work, and it might be the way that I work best.I never really feel like I've done anything if I'm not spinning a bunch of plates. Variety boosts me up. I tend to be much more productive on the current task when I know I have more lined up after it. I&rsquo;ve done a fair bit of production work, work for clients, work to hard deadlines. I&rsquo;ve found that both variety and deadlines are equally valuable in keeping me motivated and moving forward. When those two are well balanced, I tend to more productive. Tip too far toward variety and I don&rsquo;t get anything finished, tip to far toward deadlines and all my work is garbage. Too little of either and my motivation goes out the window.Working mostly on my own means I don&rsquo;t have clients, or their deadlines. I also work from home and fit development in where I can, so I don&rsquo;t really get the volume of work done to make a dent in most projects. So I have the variety, I just need the deadlines. Deadlines that are actually attainable for the way I have to work. So here's what I'm gonna do. I will put up a new post on this blog every Monday. Some of them will be quite small and some of them won't. Most of them will be about game development in some way or another.Why? Well I've been working on a game for a while. You can see some of the concept art for it over in this image gallery. I&rsquo;m not working alone. I&rsquo;ve been working with another local developer. His Blog is over here.Why every Monday? I want to ramp up the asset creation part of development, and a sure way to force myself to do steady work is to build to a schedule. So every Monday I will put up a new blog post detailing some aspect of this games development. If you have any questions, please send them my way and I&rsquo;ll try to do a breakdown of the process. We&rsquo;ll call this post 001. \t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tMal Reynolds:&nbsp; It's my estimation that every man ever got a statue made of him was one kind of a son of a bitch or another.&nbsp;Think about some of your favorite game protagonists. Quite probably, they are an asshole.I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this for quite a while, but the thing that really drove it home was playing the Uncharted series. The protagonist, Nathan Drake, is presented as a likable Indiana Jones type, affable, &nbsp;replete with foibles and failings, but ready to dust it up when he needs to. As written, he is layered and interesting, in an adventure serial sort of way. And then you play the game. As the player it is your job to direct &ldquo;Nate&rdquo; through all his trials. All indications are, that this will mean hair raising adventure, narrowly avoiding disaster, and dodging death with a joke and a rakish smile. What really happens is that you repeatedly murder scores of dudes. Seriously. Angry, armed men spew forth from the masonry, and you direct \"Nate\" to gun down, or beat to death, every last one of them. The titular assassin in the Assassins Creed series could not hope to compete with the raw dude killing prowess of Nathan Drake, and dude killing is sort of in his job description.I enjoyed the Uncharted games quite a bit. I enjoyed the pulp serial characters and story, and I enjoyed the cover based action combat. But never both together. The disconnect I felt was due to the story constantly insisting that this character is a decent and likeable human being, when the guy I'm controlling is clearly sociopathic, and borderline psychotic. A lot of games put you in the position of the one man army punching a hole through evil. That player character is either an empty cipher with no personality but what the player assigns to it, or they are presented as an emotionally broken person, worn down by war and struggles for survival. Were you to meet them in a civil setting, they would most likely be an asshole.How do we tell if someone we meet is an asshole? Typically they express it through their interaction with the world. They tend to be blunt, disruptive, destructive, or all three. The koopas and goombas in Mario games rarely go out of their way to intercept and harass Mario. They just walk diligently along until you direct Mario to stomp on their heads. The enemies in most FPS games are slightly more in control of their own fate, and they do actively assail your avatar, but seriously what was your guy doing, staring them down in the first place. Wouldn't most normal people give the violent gang ahead of them a wide berth. Didn't Nathan Drake venture into these caves, to find treasure. I would think that armed conflict would be detrimental to that goal. Unless of course he's sort of an asshole, then by all means, march right in and start killing dudes.Now, To be sure, I've killed my fair share of digital baddies. Probably a few other people's share as well. I've enjoyed it too. Almost always I was at least peripherally aware that my character was sort of an asshole. Games are usually a no options environment. I had to kill all the nazis to escape from castle wolfenstein. Had to. All of them. &ldquo;But Owen&rdquo; you say &ldquo;all those soldiers/pirates/aliens/molemen were evil, you had to kill them to save the world, your character is not an asshole, he&rsquo;s a hero&rdquo; Me: hey (insert game hero here) the way you escaped from that (pow camp/spaceship/hell dimension) was amazing, and thanks for saving the world. Hero: Not a problem. Just part of the job.Me: So, tell me what happened in there.Hero: Well I had to fight the first few guards hand to hand until I got ahold of one of their weapons. Me: Oh wow! So then you busted out?Hero: Nope. First I had to deactivate the doomsday weapon, and shoot all the guards in the head. Me: Holy Crap! Thanks for doing that. It sounds terrible. Hero: Don&rsquo;t mention it. Like I said, just part of the job. So then I doubled back to loot the armoury, shooting guys in the head the whole time. Me: Okay. Looting the armoury? That was really important?Hero: Oh yeah. Very important part of the mission. I needed the bigger weapons to shoot all the minibosses, and then the main boss.Me: Really? I mean, you deactivated the doomsday weapon right?Hero: Oh yes, of course. Then I was trapped in a checkpoint room where I shot every bad guy in the head so that the door would open. Me: What!? Why!? How does that work? What was keeping the door closed?Hero: Not sure really. I just shot everyone, and then the door opened. That wasn&rsquo;t the only time that happened either. One time I had to search around for one of the little grunts and shoot him in the head before the door would open. He must have clipped through a catwalk, and got caught up in some geometry. I had to use an entire clip trying to hit him in the head. Ha.Me: Jesus!? Why didn&rsquo;t you just leave him there?Hero: Had to open the door. If you can think of a better way of opening doors than shooting heads, I&rsquo;d like to hear it. Anyway, I should tell you how I tracked down the final boss, destroyed his armour, and shot him repeatedly in his exposed brain!Me: What. The. Fuck. (scooch away silently and exit room, close door slowly)See what I mean. That guy was a bit frightening. Also, probably an asshole. Not that it was entirely his fault. The problem wasn&rsquo;t really with that character's intentions. He was trying to save the world after all. He is very definitely &lsquo;the good guy&rsquo;. The only way this guy could interact with the world around him was to shoot it, punch it, or set it on fire. Possibly with a flaming fist gun. Almost every Slam bang action movie hero kills a few baddies along the way, but they also outthink, outtalk, and outrun their opponents. One of the best, thrill ride, action movies of all time, The Fugitive, has the hero constantly making choices, and interacting with the world around him, in as non-violent a fashion as he can, considering the situation he finds himself in. In that movie, Richard Kimble&rsquo;s interactions with the world define his character. He is most certainly not an asshole. There are quite a few character action games that eschew this asshole norm. The Deus Ex series is lauded for offering so many ways for the player to interact with the world that it is possible for the player to have an almost completely non-violent experience moving through what is otherwise a shadowy, violent world. Some games, like Journey, furnish the player with no violent interactive options at all. Not only are these interactive options available to game creators, but simply including them as possibilities in a game can create a richer experience. When press and game players are introduced to a new character action game, one of the boilerplate questions is always &lsquo;how is the combat?&rsquo;. Maybe we should strive for better than that. We interact with the the world around us every moment of our existence. My hunch is that very little of our life experience is violent, disruptive, or otherwise assholish. A game like Mirrors Edge would arguably be better had they just dropped the option for combat entirely. After saying all this, I&rsquo;ll likely want to play, or even make, a game where you shoot things in the face. In the realm of action power fantasy there is a place for that kind of game. The interactive palette is broader than that though. Where are the action games about swimming, or fire fighting, or more abstract fare, like navigating hyperspace, or living the life of a bee. Some exist, Even more are being made, now that the tools to create them are widely, and cheaply available. Someday, very soon, a game character will evoke real empathy, from a wide, and diverse audience. That characters interactions with the world will define them. They will not be an asshole. \t\t"

About a half hour after downloading it I made this.         15 minutes later it looked like this.         Then I did this in 40 minutes. The video is only about 2 minutes. I just sped up the recording to&nbsp;tolerable&nbsp;levels.    Sure, they aren't stellar sculptures. Unfinished sketches really. I had no plan when I started each of these, I was just messing around with the tools, trying to see what I could do with them. My experience was absolutely frictionless.I love discovering new tools. There is always that crusty old man voice in my head remembering how hard all this used to be. How I had to build up models a polygon at a time, or animate without IK. The voice is still there, but it has been getting quieter and quieter. With&nbsp;Unity3D,&nbsp;Blender&nbsp;(now that they have a sensible UI),&nbsp;Silo,&nbsp;Gimp, etc. the tools have never been better or easier to use, and now a lot of them are affordable, or even free. Did I mention that Sculptris is free. Sometimes I feel like I could just mash my hand on the keyboad and, something cool will pop up on screen. The crusty old man voice wants to hate that, but honestly, tools like these, are just to awesome to hate.&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI've been working on a lot of experimental things. Many of them have been in the&nbsp;builds, and you might have seen some of them. Some others, I have been working on in other scenes and tests. Since I haven't set up the ability to play with previous builds (still coming), I figured I should give a quick run down of some of these experiments.On the ballProbably the most difficult challenge so far has been to get the endless spherical world working. I started by creating the&nbsp;obvious. I made a sphere and the built in sphere physics collider, and put the truck on it. That was an absolutely spectacular failure. The truck would go shooting off in random directions, jiggle violently in place, or fall trough the planet (sphere). Often it would do all three. I figured that this wouldn't be&nbsp;adequate&nbsp;to the task, but it never hurts to try for very simple&nbsp;straightforward&nbsp;solutions.Next I tried setting up a sort of artificial gravity. The physics engine has a built in gravity that applies a force of 9.8 newtons along the negative y vector. Simply put, stuff falls down. I needed stuff to fall toward the center of the planet. Lucky for me a lot of other people over at the unity forums had done a bunch of that work, so I only needed to modify it. Once I adapted some of the other artificial gravity systems and simplified them for my needs, it actually wound up being one line of code. The object with gravity applied to it simply looks for the center of the planet and then moves toward that with 9.8 newtons of force. Done.So the artificial gravity worked fine, but stuff would still keep flying off the sphere collider, and would occasionally end up in orbit around the planet.&nbsp;Literally. I could hit a garbage can with enough force that it would fly off the planet ending up in a perpetual free fall. It was really funny, and I might use it for something later on, but it meant that, given enough speed, the truck would also leave the surface of the planet, and that was pretty much the end of the fun. The truck would also freak out pretty&nbsp;regularly&nbsp;and usually fall through the planet The main&nbsp;culprit turned out to be the sphere collider. For any math nerds out there, this is probably pretty obvious. A sphere is not a really a stable shape to set things down on. So I ditched the sphere.The next obvious road was to create a mesh collider. The physics engine and the graphics work off of&nbsp;separate&nbsp;models. The physics engine really only works with very simple objects. The graphics on the other hand can be very complex with little to no slowdown on most devices. For every object that you want to react to gravity or collisions, you will need both a physics and a display model. Using a mesh collider, you can effectively, use the same mesh for both, if the display model is simple enough. Making a decent looking sphere requires a pretty dense and complicated mesh. So that was a no go.The best collision objects in the engine tend to be cubes or boxes. So I hit on an idea that worked out really well. I figured, why not have the truck just bring the ground along with it. I made a box that's a little larger than the truck and placed it just under the wheels. Then I made a script that told the box to follow the truck around &nbsp;so no matter where the truck drove in the world, it would bring its piece of ground with it. On a flat surface it worked fantastically. I went about adapting my artificial gravity code to make the collider rest on the surface of the planet sphere and rotate smoothly around the center of the planet to stay positioned under the truck. That also worked very well, but caused some other problems with the camera flipping over and the the controls would sometimes jank out when the truck passed over the poles due to an unfortunate side effect of&nbsp;Euler&nbsp;angle math called gimbal lock. Here is one of the best&nbsp;explanations&nbsp;I've ever seen of&nbsp;gimbal lock.    So I could go back and change all the code I had in place for making the truck move around, or I could change the rules of the game world. So I did that. Instead of driving the truck around a ball that sits stationary in space, the truck drives around on a flat XZ plane and the planet follows around underneath it rotating in the opposite direction. And the rotations are all using&nbsp;quaternion math, so gimbal lock won't be a problem. Any object that doesn't require player input, like the garbage cans and blocks aren't affected by gimbal lock, so they just roll around on their own little ground colliders and everything looks like it is resting on a sphere.So that is how I went from driving around on a flat plane to driving around on a ball. That's pretty much the stuff I think about day to day working on TurboGarbageTruck. I'm certain that there are better ways to do all the things I'm doing, but development is an iterative process and I should gradually figure out what works best for this game.I've set up a twitter account so you can follow development over on the right there. I'll tweet any time a new build goes up or I do anything&nbsp;significant&nbsp;with the development, like posting up concept art, videos, or blog posts. You can also follow me @Owen_McManus for dev and non dev related tweeting.&nbsp;\t\t"

Seriously, this an anthropomorphic garbage truck who's sole purpose is to alternatively smash and gather things in his world, to make a larger and larger garbage pile. I'm really just designing him as a character because I find it entertaining.I compressed about 45 minutes of sketching down to 3 for the video. Much longer than that and some of the slower bits really get pretty boring to watch.    I have never recorded myself sketching. It's weirdly intimidating. Most of that self conscious feeling I use to have when someone would watch me draw or paint has faded with practice and time. Now, if someone comes to peek over my shoulder while I'm drawing, or modelling, I don't really worry about what they think of my doodles. I'm usually much more concerned that they will just get bored. Recording myself sketching, I'm just worried that the screen capture will break or the computer will crash. It felt like I was drawing to beat the clock. After a few minutes I sort of relaxed into it a bit, but this is definately a new process, and it will take me a while to get comfortable. Modelling with the screen capture running will be... interesting.\t\t"

It's not really a design doc. It's really just a list of things that I want to add or test out. I expect that I will grow the list fairly steadily and then drastically hack it down when it grows too unwieldy.In the latest builds I've been conducting some experiments. I created an infinite terrain setup. Essentially if you drive out the north side of the environment you will come back in the south side. You can drive in one direction forever... or until the physics break and the truck falls through the world. This is just stage one of a larger experiment with&nbsp;continuous&nbsp;environments. So far so good.The truck flips over way too easily. Working on it.Also, currently there is no limit to the speed that the truck can reach. You can break the sound barrier in that mofo. Still not sure if that is good or bad.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tMy newest game&nbsp;experiment is up.It's TurboGarbageTruck... a name and concept stolen entirely from my son. So... not really my idea.I have a theory that feedback on a game (or quite probably any other media) can't be gathered too early. I suppose it isn't much of a theory, and it really isn't my theory either, since every major developer employs, or keeps employed, dedicated testing staff. Feedback is what these people do. It's all they do. It's less of a theory and more of an imperative. And again, not my idea.I've talked about \"open kimono\" development before. I've also seen this referred to as \"open door\" or \"transparent\" development. The basic idea is that you let your potential players in on the development of your game as much as possible, while you are making it. Demos, tests, concepts, design documents... they are all on the table. I posted up builds of my last project while I was working on it, but I really didn't commit to open development. I think I know why very few developers even attempt it.It's scary as shit.There is that old chestnut \"you never get a second chance to make a first impression\". So I could go ahead and post up all my dev builds, any concept art, any design docs, knowing that the first version of any or all of those things will probably be garbage. Going by the first impression rule, that would sour anyone who saw it on all future versions of the game. The damage would have been done with the first broken play test. A trend toward development secrecy almost goes without saying, if this first impression rule has any merit. It does and it doesn't.Minecraft.Kickstarter.Everyone brings up Minecraft. Constantly. For good reason. It's a goddamn phenomenon. When it was first released, no one would have guessed that it would be a phenomenon. No one. Because it sorta sucked. Mojang didn't catch lightning in a bottle. They built steam slowly, one beta version at a time. Only thing is,&nbsp;slowly&nbsp;in internet time is anything longer than six months. To those not acquainted with internet time, this is pretty much the same as instant. Had they toiled in secrecy for that same amount of time and released the current version of Minecraft whole hog, to an unsuspecting internet, I suspect it would be met, initially, with a collective meh.Minecraft isn't some strange exception to the rule either. Kickstarter is a funding and business model pretty much built around showing your work. Offering updates and \"making of\" style information to the people who will fund your project is pretty much a requirement. I doubt that there are any successful projects on Kickstarter that say \"Fund my project. It's a super great idea that I can't tell you about.\"I only chose these two examples because they are current and relevant to indie game development. There is a long history of \"patrons of the arts\" which is short for \"I will pay you to let me look over your shoulder while you work\". That's exactly where the first impression rule breaks down. If you are meeting someone face to face and you know that they will be judging you, as a person, by all means, bring your A game. When it comes to \"things\" the rule no longer holds up. In fact the exact opposite is true. Everyone likes to watch things being built. Skyscrapers, houses, cars, paintings, movies, and yes games. As long as you don't have to do the work yourself, watching it get done is fascinating. I've lost count of the amount of people who stood around to watch me apply decals to their car. Where things that people are building are concerned, it would probably be more accurate to say that the final impression is what matters. If the final work resonates, any problems during the making are forgiven. People have died while making movies. Died! Making movies! Successful ones. As a first impression, I can't think of much worse.So transparent development shouldn't really be all that scary. I understand the need to withhold some details. Plot twists, puzzle solutions, easter eggs, etc. Most players have such an aversion to anything that would spoil their fun, and rightly so, that they would likely cry foul if you released that stuff anyway. Any other development details really don't need any protection. In fact, I think a lot of the best big budget titles could benefit from transparent development. Patrons of the arts love to look over the shoulder of their heroes at work.I'm starting TurboGarbageTruck in the most transparent way I can think of. I'll let you play it. I'll be adding a method for you to play all the previous builds and experiments too. As I get to scanning them I'll be posting up concept art and maybe even design docs (though this game sort of speaks for itself). I'll definitely be posting up my road maps and upcoming features. Please feel free to ask me if you want to know more about anything I'm working on, or if you just want to call me out on anything I'm doing that you think is bullshit. I'm good with that.Update: When I wrote this I hadn't read the Game Developer article where John Graham of&nbsp;Wolfire Games&nbsp;pretty much breaks down how and why open development works. If you're looking for an example they seem to be the current masters.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\trebootOkay, I&rsquo;ve been working on the same project for ages. In multiple languages, and a couple different frameworks. My plan from the outset was to create something small so that I could learn the tools and languages I would need to create my own games. Not clickity click around in some game builder either. I wanted to have a really firm grasp of what I was building. I wanted to write the code, and work with the tools on a fairly low level. That said, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, I&rsquo;m not a complete idiot. I realize that the constraints of time and familiarity with the tools wouldn&rsquo;t allow me to create my own game engine, or anything like that. I started by Using first XNA, dabbling with OGRE, and then settling on Unity. All three allowed me to work quickly enough to see progress, but still required that I learn JavaScript or C# and, more importantly, some work flow, structure, and design strategies.If, in the future, I&rsquo;m ever provided with an opportunity to work with a programmer more skilled than myself, a parrot or eggplant for example, I&rsquo;ll at least understand what they are talking about.I just recently created an app for the Blackberry Playbook. It is currently going through approval. It is a very small, very simple toy for very young children. Random shapes bounce around the screen and you poke at them to make them burst and fade away. You also hear a satisfying sound. That&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s called ShapeToy. The point is, simple or not, ShapeToy is a completed app. It&rsquo;s a finished thing. That you can play with. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that I couldn&rsquo;t have done that a year ago. The main problem with &ldquo;Color Game&rdquo; is that I never really designed it as a game. I created a school, and sent myself too it. Like school, learning was the point, and anything that you created has very little value as a stand alone work. There may be something that I can dig out of that and polish up into a game. ShapeToy was designed for a specific purpose. Until I reconsider the color game concept as a game first, it will never really be successful. So I have decided to shelve Color Game for a bit until I can really rethink it. I have started up 3 new projects. Each one designed to be a game first. I&rsquo;ll likely learn something along the way, but these projects are all focused on the finished product, not the process. I&rsquo;ve started on the one that seems to be the most unabashedly &ldquo;video game&rdquo;. If, or rather, when I get hung up on some issue, I will bounce around to the other two projects, hopefully learning something new and clearing any mental blocks. I fully intend for at least one, if not all of these projects to be finished things. That people can play, or even buy. Probably on a phone. I&rsquo;ve already started working on the next iteration of ShapeToy, that includes letters, numbers, and different sounds. I&rsquo;m just waiting on a tool update from RIM that makes some of the local file storage/access features of HTML5 useable from an app. Since I think there is still an enjoyable core to the thing, I&rsquo;ll probably dive back into Color Game as well, but for now, I think I&rsquo;ll focus on making some games. &nbsp;\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tprevious posts in this seriesIntroRandomizationEngagementAsymmetryBefore writing this I tried really really hard to think of a sport that is asymmetric. Baseball and Cricket are played asymmetrically, with one team in the field and one team at bat, but the game requires each team to take turns at bat or in the field, making the game, overall symmetrical. It is possible that you could consider hunting and fishing to be asymmetric sports, with the hunter versus the prey. Hunting is not really a game, but a primary survival skill of human beings, as predatory animals. As a survival skill, people finding fun and engagement from hunting is fairly easy to understand. People also enjoy eating and using the toilet. These are not things that most would consider games. If there is any game to be made of hunting, then it is a competition between the hunters and not actually between the hunter and the prey. Of course that makes hunting and fishing, again, symmetric.Many games (board games, and video games) have played with the idea of asymmetry. The playground game \"tag\" is a great example of an asymmetrical game. Playing a game of tag never requires every player to be \"it\". A player could play tag for hours and never be \"it\". For the players that aren't \"it\", the game can be fun and engaging, but, as any kid will tell you, tag is more fun when you are \"it\". Video games, likely starting with breakout, but then really with space invaders, made sure that the player is always \"it\".The really difficult design problem that space invaders, being a video game, solved is that it sucks being the guy who is supposed to lose. It is much more fun to catch one player after another as \"it\" than to be one of many people waiting to be caught. No human would ever willingly play as the space invaders. This is the playground role handed out to little brothers and sisters for centuries. The dutiful punching bag. This is a role only a computer opponent could relish. A cursory glance at the standard game board of space invaders would lead most to believe that the player is faced with overwhelming odds and will need to call on all their dexterity and focus to prevail. That only becomes true as the game progresses. For the first few minutes the player is omnipotent. You are the one in control of the game and the computer will suffer the beating you dole out and keep coming back.Maybe I should change my terminology. It is probably not so important that space invaders be a \"video\" game. It could be an incredibly complex mechanical shooting gallery. What is more important is that it is a \"computer\" game. Sure, you could compete against other players to see who can set a higher score, making space invaders a symmetric game, but it doesn't require another human player to be a complete game. It only requires a computer. A computer that doesn't care that its only role will always be the \"not its\" to the players \"it\".Having this perpetual digital soup can available for the beating, changed game design. Ideas that you would never be able to get a team of real humans to rally behind, became the norm for video games. The next time you have a bunch of people around getting ready to play, soccer, hockey, baseball, football... or really any other sport, ask them if they would all rather line up and run straight at you while you punch them, one at a time, in the nose and crotch. They will probably tell you that idea doesn't sound like much fun. Then ask a computer. Computers are always up for it.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tprevious posts in this seriesIntroRandomizationIf it wasn't already painfully clear, I really am not speaking from a place of authority here. I really don't know if what I'm writing is accurate, or completely ass backward. I'm exploring what I think makes a game a game. These three elements are what I've managed to come up with so far. Feel free to tell me if I'm completely out to lunch.EngagementThis is one of those words that can be used very vaguely. Like describing something as artistic, or jazzy. When someone is describing a game and they can't come up with any nuanced description of why they kept playing, they sometimes say that it is engaging. That's really it... engagement is whatever keeps someone playing. It's a catch all. Engagement can come from almost any source. It might be a genuine interest in the game mechanics. How much you like the people you play with. Neurotic compulsion. Flat out, unhealthy, addiction.Engagement changes a series of random events into a game. This is where the rubber meets the road. Literally. In physical terms, engagement is joining two or more objects, imparting the motion of one on the other. Either object can be the instigator of motion, and they can reverse rolls, but the end effect is that engagement of two objects propels the whole forward. Or backward. The effects of engagement don't need to be positive. They only need to be continuous. If one object repels the other, they are no longer engaged. The game ends.Engagement, when used to describe game play, means that the player is invested in the game beyond the \"fun\". Beyond the random. Dice roles are not engaging. Flipping over cards is not engaging. Nearly all card and board games build engagement the easiest way possible... by having you play with other people. Probably people who are your friends. You will play shit that bores you to tears, because you enjoy your friends. In the absence of other people, most video games create engagement by pretending to be other people playing against you. If there was no randomization or the randomization was not obfuscated, the player would feel like they were fighting a game system rather than invaders from... you know... space.Sometimes that system might be enough. Solitaire is intensely engaging, but the mechanics and the randomization are outright blatant. Not obscured at all. For me the engagement in solitaire comes from the brevity of the game... one round tops out around 10-12 minutes, and the rapid fire reveal of the randomized cards. Every flipped card could change the whole game, and you are flipping one of those buggers every couple seconds. Aside from games like poker or backgammon that let the other players engage you, most types of gambling engage in the same way. Speed and repetition. The promise of money doesn't hurt either I suppose.Space Invaders builds engagement in a couple different ways. First, there are the random events. Bomb drops mostly. People can't help but try to find pattern and intent in random events. Especially if those events are not explicitly random. We can't see past the graphics on the screen to divine if the game mechanics and systems are random or intelligent and directed. Whenever that happens, people default to intelligent and directed. That's just what we do. Exploiting that aspect of our collective psychology is a constant source of engagement for many, many games. Works for religions too... but I don't think I'll get into that.Secondly, space invaders builds engagement in almost the exact opposite way. The movement of the invaders is plodding, predictable, and almost entirely unchanging for as long as you play the game. This absolute rigid system is easy for a player to absorb. You know exactly where every invader is going to be at any given time during the game. While the random elements provide the moment to moment, heart skipping tension, the pattern and repetition allow the player to develop a longer term strategy.Those seem to be the key two ways the game engages the player. Of course, what works for some people, won't work for others. The main draw for some people might be the distinctive glow of the phosphors, or some specific tone in one of the sound effects. It's hard to tell what might butter a dudes bread. Certain ticks of our individual psychologies are similar enough that a persons responses can, occasionally, be predicted with some amount of accuracy.People like patterns. People like being surprised. People like to get better at predicting, and reacting to, subsequent surprises. Predictable surprises form patterns. Loop.This is the recipe for engagement.It all boils down to this.Randomization = PlayRandomization + Engagement = GameI have one more element to cover. Asymmetry. Games don't require asymmetry, but Space Invaders does. I'm going to attempt to cover why asymmetry is the basis for modern video games, and why it's what makes video games different from most other forms of game. My post on engagement went way longer than I had hoped ( and still barely covers the topic ), so I'll save asymmetry for next time.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tRandomizationMost, if not all games, contain some element of randomization. I'm talking games here, all games, not just video games. Ball bounces, dice rolls, card shuffles, are all complex enough equations that, as far as the average human brain is concerned, they are effectively random. Often, as is the case with chess or checkers, the random element is provided by a second human. Maybe this is not so much \"random\" as it is simply the obscured or inscrutable tactics of another human player. The end result is the same. We simply don't know what will happen moment to moment, and we need to react to events as they unfold. Successfully predicting, or reacting to a random event makes people feel excitement, elation, a sense of accomplishment. Otherwise known as fun.In a round of space invaders, while the enemies will always march back an forth across the screen and descend one step at a time until they reach the bottom, apparently crushing the feeble defenses the earth has mustered against them.That is all you know for certain.When will the enemies excrete their squiggly bombs. When will the mother-ship grace the screen, enticing you to chase it for some easy points, even if it means leaving protective cover. That information is completely obscured from the player. These moment to moment reactions create the tension required to make you feel like you have bested the invaders. They attacked. You out thought and out fought them. It was probably fun.Fielding a few grounders can be fun, but you can't really call it a game. Randomization alone won't hold a players interest for long. You need a second element. Engagement. By keeping the randomization hidden from the player, it's easy for them to interpret an invaders random bomb drop as a deeply malicious and directed attack. I'll dig into that in a bit.There is, seemingly, an alternative to the randomization = fun theory. Puzzles. Puzzles are a strictly linear problem to solve. They are, in fact, not random at all. In practice however the effect is the same. The solution to a puzzle is hidden from the player in such a way that it may as well have been random. A puzzle is like a dice roll that comes up 4 every time. Predicting or reacting to the dice roll the first time will provide the player with that feeling of fun. Once. Working through, and solving a puzzle will also provide the feeling of fun once. Puzzles by themselves are like fielding grounders. They aren't games, but string a bunch of puzzles together and you start to see the makings of a game.So if randomization can create fun, but random events aren't, in and of themselves, games, what else is required?Next upEngagement\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tjust a quick aside.Before I put up my post on randomization in video games, I thought I should make a comment on the latest build of \"colour game\" (working title).The latest build of the game is up. I had previously,&nbsp;incrementally&nbsp;updated the graphics every few builds... in this build I ripped them out entirely. Every object in the game is represented by some primitive (sphere, cube, etc.).I found that I couldn't even look at the game without wanting to change something about the visual state of that nonsense. I like working on the art side. I find modelling enjoyable, and photoshop can be downright relaxing, even under deadlines. Even thought the art wasn't even 20% of the way completed, I just couldn't stop thinking about it. It was definitely having an effect on how much thought and effort I put into the code and game play. The solution was simple. Remove art from the prototype. Any art and graphic design I do for the game is now on paper or modeled&nbsp;separately and not imported into the game. This also forced me to create a more clean and clear hierarchy structure for all my game assets that lets me swap out the primitives with finished models fairly trivially.&nbsp;&nbsp;Good stuff.I'm pretty sure that this is the way I will&nbsp;prefer&nbsp;to work moving&nbsp;forward. When I used to do vinyl vehicle wraps and decals we always used the nastiest magenta illustrator could muster as the stand in colour. If the area was part of the design that was supposed to be cut out, or just an area where the artwork wasn't complete, it would always be that terrible magenta. The reasoning was that if whoever was running the printer at the time saw that they would know not to print the file, because no client would ever want that colour on their vehicle. Valve uses a similar approach in level design by building everything out of orange boxes. If I could find something to use more&nbsp;hideous than a flat lit cube as my stand in prototyping object, I would.&nbsp;I also spent the last month just stripping the game down to the nuts and rebuilding most of it from scratch. It really didn't take very long, since I work on this less than an hour a day most weeks. Less on other weeks. I had learned quite a lot building everything the first few times, so it was time to toss out all the, sprawling, old broken code and write some new, tidier, marginally less broken code.Next post:a&nbsp;thoroughly&nbsp;absorbing and delightful mess of pedantic nerdy bullshit.Randomization\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tSpace InvadersThat's it. I'm making space invaders. Enemy blips locked in an inevitable march toward one lone protagonist.I think I come by it honestly. An awful lot of video games are space invaders. Think about all the video games you have ever played... now really think... how many of those are the spawn of space invaders.&nbsp;Galaxian&nbsp;and&nbsp;Galaga&nbsp;are direct descendants of space invaders, but so is&nbsp;tempest, albeit oriented in a ring rather than vertically.&nbsp;Xevious,&nbsp;1942, also space invaders... but now the background scrolls.&nbsp;Robotron 2084&nbsp;is space invaders with no constraints on axis for the player or the enemies. I think the simple reason is, space invaders only works as a video game. Sure there are video games that predate space invaders, even other shooting gallery video games, and space invaders itself has roots in the electromechanical shooting galleries popular decades before. Space invaders added a level of randomization, engagement, and asymmetry that didn't exist before then. Most video games before then were either two player affairs, or very repetitious and predictable games like&nbsp;breakout. While having another player definitely adds the randomization and engagement, it almost by definition requires a level of symmetry.Randomization, engagement, and asymmetry. I have whittled it down in my brain to these three elements. These are, what I believe, the elements that make Space Invaders the starting point for the modern video game. They are also central tenets of video games that differentiate them from most other types of games (board games, sports, etc).I was in the process of writing one epic post all about what I think makes a video game different from other forms of games. Instead I'll offer a reprieve from my long winded nerdformation. I'm gonna break this description into a bunch of parts and post them one at a time. Eventually I'll probably stumble over what this has to do with the game I'm making.next time on games by mistakeRandomization\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tMonths ago I wrote a checklist. I did a breakdown of my short and long term to do's. When I went to look them over today I found that I had done them. all of them.umm... I sort of didn't expect that.The checklist was only for the proof of concept demo... basically could I make some shit move around the screen in response to input. could I do it in less than an hour a day, while learning the tools and C#... in that same hour. I suppose the answer was, yes, yes I could. Dullard as I might be, I managed it.so, what now. now the tough part. can I take this proof of concept and turn it into a game.I have started on version 3 of the interface, which includes all the required elements for versus and single player modes. I have my new checklist going that includes all the gamey elements, like stats and a parser for moving all the gamey data to and from some xml files. Some character and enemy designs... really the part I enjoy most.I think the biggest change in the near future will be moving the colour mixing model from the overly simplistic wheel to something a bit more fluid. I'll still be using a red, yellow, blue, colour model, which, yes I know, isn't really accurate in any study of colour theory, but it is easy to wrap your head around. Sure, you have your rgb, cmyk, lab, and whatever is in your pantone fandeck, but honestly, I may have fudged the gamut, but everyone knows that red and yellow make orange, yellow and blue make green, and blue and red make purple (they really don't but if you don't tell, I won't).so here's to hoping that in a few months you might be able to load up the newest build and fight a monster... with colour!also, if you've read this far, what else would you be interested in reading... or seeing. concept art? design docs? code? let me know, maybe I'll put in a post.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tNew Graphics!Yay!'cept they are only marginally better than the old graphics, you might say. you would be right. but the groundwork is there for them to improve a bit at a time now. The old version had too many problems with pivot locations and ambiguous rotation angles. What was very broken is now less broken.or you might say I still don't know what's going on here. you are in good company. I have an idea where this is headed and it still looks like thick nonsense soup sometimes.or you could even ask, is this really even a game? it doesn't seem... you know .... fun. probably isn't. on both counts. I have spent the last month or so gutting out the junk and replacing it with the bones of an actual game.So here is my problem. I work on this game for maybe an hour or so a day, on average. If I am coding I can usually make decent use of that time... if I am doing anything graphics related, forgetaboutit. I have the ability to pour a ton of time into anything graphics. 3D, 2D, video ... whatever. Now, I've done graphics work under deadline. Quite a lot of it, and some real bastard hard deadlines too. That I can do. There is an end that you are trying to achieve. As soon as I leave that focused mentality and give in to the meandering undulations of \"concept development\" I might be better off just shutting down the PC and staring at the wall. I could sit in front of photoshop or maya for days, feverishly grinding away, and have jack all to show for my time by the end. I'm honestly doubt that it is a problem unique to me. Maybe I should just try to work on any art on this project in short focused bursts, rather than, once again, rebuilding the entire interface from scratch.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tSo my UI design was lousy. really really lousy.but that is A-OK.See, the real purpose of doing this game... and writing this blog, is just to learn.I set about the task of creating a throw away game... something that I would build to learn the tools, learn some coding, just simply get something built. Now if it turns out the game is any fun, then I would dive right in and finish the thing, but this will not likely be the case. This game will probably always suck. that is A-OK too.I am rebuilding the game graphics, and therefore the entire UI to make everything a bit more clear... not a ton, but a bit.This is the fourth full go round on the graphics, not including minor tweaks and additions. This is also the third time I have programmed it. The game started out on the xna framework and then I quickly moved to the unity engine.... much better. I started coding it in javascript and then moved over to C#.... also much better. Every time I learn more and more about the nuts and bolts. Occasionally I learn something about actual game design, but that seems to be a long term education kind of thing.In redoing the graphics I'm trying to learn how to create a more clear and usable UI, while resisting the artist tendency to try to build \"finished\" assets.Of course all this learning is difficult when you are, occasionally, as profoundly stupid as I can be.but that is A-OK.\t\t"

    "content": "\t\t\t\tI put up a new build a bit ago, but you probably won't notice any differences. All th changes are under the hood. I'm rooting through and cleaning up code as I go. Bad shit goes out and slightly improved shit goes in.This is all part of the iterative process.Also being iterated, are all the graphics. The final look will hopefully be somewhere between story book paintings and slick art deco design. Figure that out... I haven't.At the moment I am relearning some art tools that I used to be quite proficient at. I always spend so long between using certain tools that I almost always forget some of the most basic things about them. Every time that happens, it always reinforces this one theory in my brain. I think that a person can become an expert on a topic or at some skill, extremely quickly. Most individual skills can be picked up and developed in a matter of months, or even weeks. If you work on them continually for 1 or 2 years, you will most likely be an expert. Becoming a master will probably take the rest of your life, but becoming an expert... thats a pretty quick.Only thing is, I don't think most people see it that way. I've had so many wildly different jobs in a fairly short period of time, that I have been forced to pick up new skills, become and expert in some, and then drop them to pick up an entirely new set of skills. Most of these skills are either so encrusted with rust that it would take a few weeks to get back up to speed, or they have been flat out forgotten.Right now I'm learning to program in C#. If I kept at it, in a few years I would probably be an expert in whatever I was programming. That's not me being cocky, I think it really is just a matter of time and exposure to the task. If you ask me right now, I'm really not sure if I'll keep at it or not. I would definitely rather steer more heavily toward the art. Right now, I think I'll go reacquaint myself with some tools I used to be an expert in.\t\t"

I remembered something I thought I would jot down here. I got to the part about the founding of Activision... the company pulls in the GDP of a mid sized country now, so it's kind of fun to read about this company started by a hand full of dudes.One day I was playing Sky Jinx on the old Coleco Gemini (a knock off of the atari 2600) and I remember reading in the manual that it was created by Bob Whitehead....well holy crapI knew on some level that people actually made these games, but to my feeble brain, it may as well have been sorcery. This dude. This fairly normal looking guy, he made the game I was playing. Didn't look like a sorcerer.... just a guy.I spent a lot of school bus rides drawing game levels on foolscap after that.Seems to me, I just never stopped doing that. Doubt that I ever will.\t\t"
