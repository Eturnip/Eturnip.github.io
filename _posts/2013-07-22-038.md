Tiny update this week.  
  
I’ve been modelling more assets for the game. Most of the work is making sure that everything fits into the games grid, and each asset looks like it comes from the same world. Making sure that they work as a set. It’s tricky, but it’s a fun sort of tricky.   
  
I'll write something much longer next week.
