First off, Thank you to anyone who has been reading this blog. I have enjoyed writing it.   
  
But.   
  
I have some good news and some bad news.   
  
First the bad news. I ending the blog and all other game creation activities. It’s been a long time, most of my life really, but I have lost all interest in games. I am going to stop writing about them, playing them, and making them. But there is a good reason for it.   
  
The good news is, I’m ending my 35+ year long interest in games, and video games in particular, to follow my heart. My love of dance.   
  
If anyone would care to join me, I will be presenting my one man exploration of interpretive movement on June 14th.  
  
 

**“My left, and also my right, foot : an evening of Dancechantment”**

Coffee and cabbage rolls will be provided by Mrs. Vilve Yachke  
Everyone give her a big thank you.  
  
See you there!
