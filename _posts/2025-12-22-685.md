The saga of the nas is ongoing, but I think I have it pretty well in hand.

It’s a bunch of drives that sits and chugs along in my basement, and once in a while I write some files to it. Pretty standard stuff, but it’s one more thing that I don’t have to worry about… until I eventually do have to worry about it. That’s future me’s problem. 

Anyway, that’s about it for this post. I’ll probably have a longer one next time, where I can talk about graphics for a bit. I always like to talk about graphics for a bit.
