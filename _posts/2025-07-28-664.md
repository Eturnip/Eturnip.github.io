I’m working on the last story in a group of stories. A bouquet of stories.
Will I ever clean them up and send them off to get published? Who knows. Sometimes I just write to write, ya know.
Anyway, I had this story idea worked out, but it wasn’t really crystallized. Like, all the vibes were there, but I didn’t have the details. So, instead of typing in random things, I went to exercise. 
I have a pretty strong belief in running background processes. When you aren’t actively trying to solve a problem, but are engaged in some other task that is more or less automatic, my brain at least, runs background processes. That’s when I figure out solutions to so many problems. Or, if not solutions, different angles of attack on particular problems.
So I went to exercise and, whoosh, a whole wave of concrete ways to solve these story ideas flooded in. I had to stop at one point so that I could type up some point form story structure.
Now, I’m back at the keyboard, and other than this short aside, I have been typing in actual prose rather than just mashing away at point form notes.
I have a bunch more words to tap into this keyboard, so I think I will go do that. If I don’t it will be very late before I get it all punched in.
