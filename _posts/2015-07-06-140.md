This week I have been assembling a 3D printer kit I ordered a little while ago. I may have been under the impression that this was the thing that sucked Jeff Bridges into the computer in Tron. Turns out, it’s the exact opposite. If I build something in the computer I can have melted plastic spit out of a tiny hole until it looks like Jeff Bridges. Or something like that. Whatever. Here are some pictures.
