I like working with fonts. That should probably come as no surprise. I was, after all, a designer of signs and posters and banners, etc. for years. Working with fonts is a big part of the job. Learning and relearning the rules of shape, and spacing, and balance. Learning them and then breaking them. Fonts are one of the actually fun parts of design work.

I think I have only made my own fonts, or subsets of fonts a very few times. A few weeks ago, I did it again.

If you do any design work, you should check out fontstruct.com. It is all at once a source for free or permissive licence fonts, and a toolset to create your own.

Any time I did this work in the past I either had to use complicated, task specific, tools, or I would bend Illustrator or Affinity or some other vector based drawing tool toward creating a font. A task they can do, but aren’t particularly suited to.

Fontstruct on the other hand is almost too easy to use. It offers very quick tools to get you going, but also contains a much deeper set, if you really want to dig into font creation work.

Maybe someday soon I can post up some of the font that I worked on, but for now I will keep that under wraps. I think I just have to go tweak the uppercase M, and then I will be more happy with it. And maybe the Z. And the W. … fonts.
