I'm doing another one of those writing contest things. Writing very short stories every weekend for at least a little while.

I've only just started, so I don't really have much to say about it yet.

What I have done though, is learned a little more about how to use Obsidian. 

This is the first time since I started using Obsidian that I have had to export something written in it to a manuscript format. I have worked on some stories here in this app, but I had them in other places and other apps where the formatting had already been worked out.

You might think that it should be easy. Pick a font, set your line spacing and done, right? I wish. There are a lot of differences between how obsidian treats text and how other apps, like Word, treat text. It's much simpler and more flexible, but it's also not what people reading short stories want to see. A standard Word .doc or .docx format file is just nicer to look at in a lot of software.

I have found a bunch of .css snippets that are starting to get the format looking right, and I have a handful of ways to export. Some are easy, but aren't quite right. Some take a few more steps, but seem to get the job done.

I know this though. After a few weeks of pushing out formatted stories, I will probably have a solid workflow. And that's good, because I have a few stories here that I have to try to sell.
