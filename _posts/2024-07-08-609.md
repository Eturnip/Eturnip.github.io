Writing continues on these short contest stories. Having more time than two days is sort of nice, but it does introduce a small snag.

During the ultra fast, two day contests, I don’t have time to write multiple things or change direction if the story isn’t working. I pretty much go with my first instinct and start writing. Sometimes that works out and sometimes it doesn’t, but I don’t really have time to worry about it. I also know that everyone is in the same boat so some minor grammar issues or typos are easy to ignore completely.

Having more time means that I try to fix problems while they are happening. I do a lot more on the fly editing. This isn’t too huge of a problem for me since that’s typically how I work anyway, but, normally, I also write quite slowly.
This extra time has meant that I changed directions twice this weekend. Maybe it’s for the best, since I don’t think my first ideas were working well, but introducing doubt can make me toss out ideas that might have worked.

I’ll stop rambling about writing process and get back to it. Maybe next week I will write something about games again. That’s always fun.
