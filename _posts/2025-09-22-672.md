A few years ago I wrote about riding my bike. At the time, I rode my bike most places. I still do, but maybe not quite as often. I might not ride as often, but I think I ride more than I ever did before.

The biggest change, is that when I ride, and I ride somewhere at least a couple of times a month, I ride the whole time. I used to blend a lot of riding and taking the train. Now, I donâ€™t really take the train. I just ride the twenty or so kilometers to downtown. The four or so kilometers to the grocery store. I don't ride the train much anymore.

I still very much enjoy a longer ride. It's equal parts being sort of disconnected from the world, and hyper focused on everything around you. I have only been hit by a vehicle once, and I am not interested in trying that again. A long ride gets me into a flow state, similar to playing a good game.

This is all well and good, but it also means that my bike experiences a bit more wear and tear. Today I started fixing a broken spoke, only to realize that I don't have any of the right length spokes for my wheels, so I'm off to order more. 

Get a bike. They are fun to ride, they get you from place to place, and when you break them they are fairly easy to fix. As long as you have the parts on hand.
