Work on my own game does continue. I promise. It’s just slow.

Recently I swapped the base shader that is applied to most objects in the game. This is the bit of code that tells the computer how to apply color and deals with lights. There are about a million other things it can do, but all I’m using it for is color and lights.

I had been using a sort of hybrid shader that was part stuff I downloaded from godotshaders.com and part I wrote myself. Eventually I had replaced enough of the stuff I had downloaded that I figured it was time to just pull the bandaid off and I wrote a new shader that only incorporated the things I needed. 

Now it’s a simpler effect, but one that does only what I need.

I also wrote some more of the interaction code that lets my player character use and toss items and tools. I think that means that I only have a few more systems to get up and running before I can make a vertical slice.

My goal is to be able to get a full mission of the game out for people to demo. I would like that to happen in the next couple of months, but I’m also being realistic. I only work on this game a few hours a week and achieving any progress is a win in my book.

I think I will do a little work on the throwing mechanics now. Should be fun.
