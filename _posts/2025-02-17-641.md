Well, I wrapped up the last story for this short story competition thing. The results aren’t all in, but I did… fine.

A lot of my stories ended up somewhere in the middle of the list, but they got some decent comments. The thing with this competition is, it’s not really a competition at all. Really it’s a good way to get a lot of other writers, some of whom are very good, to look over a first draft of your work and offer a lot of opinions and advice.

The competition part of it Is just for fun, and a good way to try to push yourself, but really you do it for the reviews and comments.

Now I get to take all those comments and edit up these stories to send out. Weirdly enough, even though this is a flash (under 1000 words) competition, I think this might be the first year that I actually wrote things that could fit in a flash format.

Time to edit.
