I just prepped one story to send out (it will probably be in the hands of a publisher by the time I post this), and I am getting another one ready (again, it might be ready by the time you read this).
It’s been a hot minute since I sent out a story. I’d almost forgotten how to format a story. Almost, but not quite.
There is no single way to format a story for submission to an outlet. There is a standard, but there are usually unique requirements for each outlet. Just simple things. Specific fonts, ways to organize the header. Nothing onerous, but it does meant that you can’t just send things out on autopilot, you need to actually make the effort to figure out how an outlet likes to operate. And while you are there, maybe read some of the stories they publish and figure out if they are a good fit for what you are writing.
I will likely get back a quick rejection or two, but I have to say, I sort of missed it. Maybe I should keep fixing up the many other stories that I have sitting on the back burner. At least one of them has to be good, right? That’s just normal odds.
