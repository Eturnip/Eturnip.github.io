I’m going to try to put some screen shots and a video or gif right at the bottom of this post. I’m not sure how that will work, but hopefully it will. 

I changed something pretty fundamental to the graphics in my game, but I think it will be tough for people to figure out what changed, and that’s great. Exactly what I was hoping for.
This is where I would probably bore you with the technical details, but I think I will just hold onto this one. I wanted this game to look sort of weird, and I think I might have achieved that now. It will look weird and most people won’t know exactly why. 
Anyway, enjoy some screenshots and videos if I happen to get them working.
