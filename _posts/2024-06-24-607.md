Once again, I am working on a short (under one thousand words) story for a contest. This one is a bit different though. Where the past ones I have done are all pretty fast two day affairs, this one offers a leisurely five day window before you have to submit. That, of course, means that I spent the first two days only thinking about writing.

That isnâ€™t entirely true. I did write an outline. Something I find is a bit of a luxury when doing the super quick turnaround story competitions. Either way, This is a much more leisurely pace. We will have to see if that affects the finished quality of the work. 

I best get to it. It would be great if I could get a few hundred words down before any sort of panic sets in.
