This will be my last post for 2025. 
Does that mean I need to make some sort of resolution of the new year? A semi-hollow promise to myself? 
Nah.
I’m more than happy to make plans. Here are some things I plan to do.
I will write a few more stories, finish editing a few that I have on the go, and have at least a half dozen out for submission at any given time. 
I will finish up the gameplay loop of my game and try to get it out to a few people for playtesting.
I will work on another game and hopefully that one will be ready to go by fall.
I will do some work on yet another game, and attempt to get some very experimental visuals up and running in an engine I don’t have that much experience using.
Mostly, I plan to enjoy my work, enjoy my family, and enjoy my life.
And I plan to do all of that for as long as I possibly can.
Check in with me around 2075 and I’ll let you know how that plan is going.
