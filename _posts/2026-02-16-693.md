We are over halfway through the Winter Olympics and, yep, I've been watching a lot of them. 
Just like the summer games, It's not so much that I want to watch my favorite sports, it's that I like the variety. Just today I watched some hockey, some speed skating, some figure skating, mogul skiing, and the highlights of a curling match. I'll only ever watch the highlights of a curling match. Curling is like baseball. I've played it, and I can appreciate what people love about it, but it ain't my thing. 
It's just a firehose of sports. I'm starting to hit the point where it's wearing me out, but I still really love it. By the closing ceremonies I will have worked it out of my system and I can spend several months after virtually sports free.
A hockey game and figure skating tomorrow though. Lets Go!
