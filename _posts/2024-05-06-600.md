If you happen to be reading this where it lives on my website, you will probably notice that it all looks a little different. A little simpler. A few of the links and menus are missing. Welcome to the new home of whatever it is I’m doing here.

For the moment, there will be a few broken links and missing features. I will be gradually adding back all of that stuff, and hopefully making it a little easier to search for old posts and images here.

I will be adding a page of external links to places like my Artstation gallery or any of my published stories. With any luck, by the time you are reading this, that page will be up.

There are a handful of other things that I will be cleaning up, gradually, over time. I would like to make sections and tags more of a thing here. Tags for posts on writing or game dev, tags for entries in my Best Games series. Things like that. Doing that effectively was always sort of out of reach with the old website. Now that I have full control over all the data, it should at least be doable. I might have to write some small programs to get it done, but that’s okay. I don’t hate programming. I’m just not that great at it.

Finally, at some point I plan to dress the new digs up a bit. Change out the art, maybe play with some color here and there. Just make it overall a touch more pleasant. And don’t we all just want things to be a touch more pleasant.
