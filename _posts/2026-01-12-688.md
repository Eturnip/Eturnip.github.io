I finished writing a new flash story a few hours ago. I will probably have to go back over it and do some editing work before it’s ready to send anywhere, but this is one of the rare occasions that I don’t think I will be adding many words.

Usually, when I finish a flash story that’s only the beginning. When I think of a story idea it usually occupies a 2000-4000 word space in my head and I squish it down to under a thousand words so that it can be flash sized. But restrictions are useful, so forcing myself to keep the word count low is good exercise. It means that every word has to do some sort of job and it can’t be just progressing your eyes through to the words I really want you to read.

This story is actually flash. I could maybe add 50 or so words, but that would be about it. The style and structure demand a small word count.

My plan right now, is to give it a once or twice over and then send it out to flash publishers, maybe as early as next week. Won’t that be something.
