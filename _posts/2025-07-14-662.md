I’m still writing short stories.
Normally, I am pretty good at writing something based off prompts. It’s like rapid fire word association. I get a prompt, or a couple of prompts, as input, and my brain comes up with several potential stories a few minutes later. 
They are almost all terrible story ideas, to be sure, but I don’t really get ‘blocked’.
I think I have recently experienced the closest I have ever had to being blocked.
The last couple of stories that I have worked on have been more difficult than usual, but I think I might know why.
I think I might just be less satisfied with my usual ideas. That’s not to say that I think my older stories are bad, but the seed ideas for them, I might pass on those now rather than writing those first few lines. So it’s less of a block and more of a slower ramp up and more searching before landing on an idea that I think might make for a good story.
I don’t know if that means that I will be writing better things in the future, or maybe worse things. Maybe this is just normal, maybe it’s a passing phase. 
In any case, I do have an idea for this current story now, so I better get back to writing it.
