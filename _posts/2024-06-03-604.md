Over the weekend I participated in the first Calgary Arcade Jam. Our local game developer association has been assembling a few arcade cabinets for years. To get them kick started, we held a jam so that there would be games to play on them when they went out into the world.

I worked with Kyle Nissen to create a throwback arcade game we called [CASH CLASH](https://itch.io/jam/arcade-jam-2024/rate/2747863). Like all jam games, it's a little janky, but in a charming way, I hope.

You can play all the games that were made here [https://itch.io/jam/arcade-jam-2024](https://itch.io/jam/arcade-jam-2024)
