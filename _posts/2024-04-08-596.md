Writing recently has been … slow.

I think doing the ‘write a story every week for six weeks’ thing is great for getting a bunch of practice coming up with concepts. It’s even great for completing projects, since you pretty much have to complete them to submit them. It does burn you out on writing for a bit though.

I got back rejections for the last of the stories I had out, so for the first time in a while, I don’t have anything in a queue at a magazine. I will send them back out, well at least one of them will be going back out, but still, it’s a bit of a bummer to not have any out right now.


I know that at least one of my six week stories can probably sell, but I also didn’t want to turn around and send any out before I had a chance to really punch them up. I think I have forgotten them enough at this point to be able to edit and revise with a clear head.


And then I have my two - no - three almost finished stories that I need to wrap up and send out. Along with all the flash stories I wrote last year. So there is no shortage of things to write or submit.


I guess it’s time to go peruse the markets again.
