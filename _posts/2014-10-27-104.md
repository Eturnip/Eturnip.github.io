This is post 104. That means that I have written one post per week for two years. Most of the posts are just throwaway bits of hack writing, but once in a while I managed to string together a few cogent points using comprehensible sentences. If anyone is keeping score, I’m probably still running a minus on my stats.

I started this one post per week writing schedule so that I would be forced to practice communicating ideas clearly. I’m really not sure if I’m getting any better at it, but I’ll check back in around post 208 and we’ll find out.

Next week I have a post about building things with some pictures, so that should be nice. After that, it will probably be back to the usual 1000 words or so of videogame talk. I might mix it up a bit though. Maybe talk about cartoons.
