<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">GC</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Hello Caller. You’re on the air. What’s your name and what’s your question?</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Caller(m)</p><p>(Tom)</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Yeah hi. Glenn, hi. I’m Tom. Uh, I have a Haswing trolling motor and I keep having it cut out on me. I’m -</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">GC</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Hey Tom.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Caller(m)</p><p>(Tom)</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">I’m- Yeah?</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">GC</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Let me ask you this Tom. This is one of those little guys. Little fresh water units. You been using this motor in salt water or estuary environments Tom?</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Caller(m)</p><p>(Tom)</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">I- Sometimes, yeah.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">GC</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">These little chinese motors Tom. They just aren’t made to keep out the salt water. What happens is the salt just gets in there and eats at the contacts. Have you checked the contacts Tom?</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Caller(m)</p><p>(Tom)</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Yeah- I- no.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">GC</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">I suggest checking those contacts, even up at the battery enclosure. Salt water gets in there and just eats away at it. You can probably clean it up gently with some vinegar and get it running smooth again but you’re gonna want to look into getting an aftermarket seal or a bit beefier motor that has protection against salt water. Okay Tom?</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Caller(m)</p><p>(Tom)</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Yeah- um- okay. Thanks Glenn. I’ll check that out.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">GC</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">No Problem. Thanks for calling.(disconnection) Alright, before we take our next caller, I just want to remind everyone that Linda is home sick today, so I’m running the lines myself. If I don’t get to your question I apologize. Also I’m not going to be able to hear your questions ahead of time, so when I pick up you will be live on the air. Please don’t make me regret it (laughter). Also please try to have your questions ready and let me know who you are. You know how we like to keep it friendly over here. Alright.

Alright. We are going to get into this more in the next segment but I’m going to give you all a little preview. I’ll just be straight with you. I don’t like it. This smells like a money grab plain and simple. I will have Kenny Lake from Kenny’s Lakes tuesdays on the Great Wide Open Network here with me to close out the hour. We’ll both get into it then and really shake this one out. I know this though. I don’t like it. But like I said we can cover that later when I have Kenny on the phone. Right now we have to pay some bills.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Station ID</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">&nbsp;</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Commercial break</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">GC</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Hello.
