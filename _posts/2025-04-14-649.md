I had been writing a different thing about games for this post, but I thought instead that I would say this.

My story Birds, Vibrant and Wild, published in [Kaleidotrope's winter 2025 issue](https://kaleidotrope.net/archives-2/winter-2025/birds-vibrant-and-wild-by-owen-mcmanus/), received a nice review and recommendation in [Locus](https://locusmag.com/2025/04/worlds-of-possibility-strange-horizons-and-kaleidotrope-reviews-by-charles-payseur/). 

While that is pretty cool, I did also receive an amazingly quick rejection for another story that I thought was not too bad, so there is some balance.

Anyway, if you haven't read Birds, Vibrant and Wild, you should go do that. You can read it safely knowing that I'm not the only one who thinks you should.
