				Writing recently has been &amp;hellip; slow.I think doing the &amp;lsquo;write a story every week for six weeks&amp;rsquo; thing is great for getting a bunch of practice coming up with concepts. It&amp;rsquo;s even great for completing projects, since you pretty much have to complete them to submit them.

More recently these posts have also been about fiction writing and everything that goes along with it.Well that ends today.Unbeknownst to you, and even me, I have spent the last decade writing a collection of the filthiest limerick...

It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be fun.For a time, rhythm games were the biggest thing in the world. Dance Dance Revolution, Beatmania, Guitar Hero, Rock Band, and on and on. They still exist, of course.
