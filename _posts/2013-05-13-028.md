Really short update today.   
  
I’ve just been doing some more work on creating and setting up models for import into the game. UV unwraps, zeroing out transforms, organizing materials, that sort of thing. I have a couple of longer post and Best Games in various states of construction, but none of them felt done enough to post today. I’ll polish one of them up for next week.   
  
If anyone is interested in any longer technical writeups, something on modelling or maybe a video on some topic, let me know. I would like to try doing a video on some topic, but every time I think of something, I always go “nah. that would be boring”. I’ll let you be the judge, what would you not find boring?
