I’m partway through writing the last story for this story competition that I have been doing.

It’s a funny thing, but I have found myself trending slightly darker writing these stories. If I have a particular writing style, it’s probably to be a little tragic and a little hopeful. A little more StarTrek than Black Mirror. Well, not this time I guess.

I have written here before that one of my favourite TV shows of all time is The Twilight Zone. I love that the show often carried both pessimistic and optimistic views in a single episode. The stories could veer dark, but often while pointing to an alternative, more positive direction the story could have taken. I suppose that might be expected of a show titled The Twilight Zone. 

Maybe these stories are me testing out my take on a type of Twilight Zone. If I’m ever going to find out, I should probably get back to writing this one.
