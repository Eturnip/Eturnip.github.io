I am redesigning some of the assets for my game, because a few of them didn’t fit the gameplay and level designs.

I tried to make the airship work, but it just didn’t. So now the airship is a lifter and the ambulance is a regular ground type vehicle. I really wanted the player to be able to fly around, but creating obstacles in the air felt false and arbitrary. I know that 90s arcade games could be arbitrary, but false always feels bad.

These are just drawings, but the model will be coming along shortly.
