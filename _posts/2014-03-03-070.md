I started writing a description of the work I was doing to finish off my arcade cabinet. I was only going write about the joystick and button wiring, but as I was doing that I started to get deeper into the entire construction process. This time, I’ll leave you with a couple of pictures of the current state of things, and next time I’ll have a full rundown of what I built and why.
