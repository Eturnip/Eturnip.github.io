I have a neat little stack of stories that I am punching up for submission right now. That’s nice and all, but sometimes it can be a bit tricky to take these flash length pieces and rework them in a way that fills them out, without losing that flash length immediacy.

I’ve written somewhere around 20 stories near to 1000 words each. They are all composed of a tight core idea, with very little room left over for character development and world building. Sometimes I manage to fit one or the other in there, but getting a story out of these flash length pieces that feels complete in the way I want, is tricky.

On the other hand, they all have a rapid pace to them that makes setups and payoffs feel snappy and, occasionally, land harder than normal. So the trick is, how to add all the fun character development and world building without losing that propulsive quality.

After a few dozen more stories I will probably have some idea how to pull off both.
