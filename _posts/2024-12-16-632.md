I don’t have much to write for this one.
I thought about writing some stuff about the games I’m working on, but none of that is in a place to talk about. 
I thought about writing about writing, but that is moving forward slowly, and I will have more to talk about soon so it will have to wait. 
I thought about writing some stuff about using Linux because that is something I have been doing a bit more of recently, but that’s boring.
I could talk about games in general, but I sort of don’t want to.
It’s one of those between weeks. I have a list of topics that I can pull from when one of these between weeks pops its head up, but I thought about that too and decided, you know what, no. Sometimes it’s okay to not have anything to write about.
So that’s what this post is.
Sometimes it’s okay to not have a thing to say. Sometimes I can just sit here and type just to feel the keys. And that’s not a problem. It’s not a failure. It’s just a slow week. 
Every once in a while, that’s kind of nice.
