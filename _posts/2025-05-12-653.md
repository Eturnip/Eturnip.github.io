I wrote that whole thing last week about the rise, and repeated fall, of authentic media. It was a sort of eulogy of Giant Bomb, a website, and collection of revolving personalities, that I have followed since before its inception. I was a fan of GameSpot’s On the Spot podcast and the people there who eventually left to form Giant Bomb.

This week, the people who worked at Giant Bomb purchased it. It has now become what it always should have been. A fully independent games media, news, critique and comedy website. The people who own it could build it up or drive it off a cliff, but either way, it won’t be because they are trying to please an advertiser or pivoting to serve corporate whims. 

For what it’s worth, I think that the site has done some of the best work it ever has in the past couple of years. If the people doing that work are the new owners, Giant Bomb is probably in very good hands.

I’m excited to see what they do.
