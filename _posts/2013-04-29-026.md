Real quick one this week.   
  
I did some work on the shaders. They were a bit cryptic, with exposed floats for tuning. I cleaned all that up, and got rid of a bunch of prototype nonsense. The render cycle went from 0.4-0.6 milliseconds to 0.2-0.4 milliseconds, so that’s good, I suppose. Looks better too. I still need to profile the changes on mobile hardware, but the results should be similar.   
  
I started on a sort of switchboard that will let us control the color and lighting in a more global way, probably based on tags.   
  
The first pass on the Hero character and some of the inventory objects is done, and now I’m getting them all game ready.
