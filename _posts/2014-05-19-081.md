Finished - mostly.

I think that building an arcade cabinet is probably the type of project that you never really finish. There are roughly twenty seven thousand tweaks, additions, and adjustments that I could still make. I suppose I could say that I hit a plateau. Every button is wired up and working. The sticks function beautifully. I still need to rig up a stand for the tv, but any TV or monitor could, as Intended, be used as a display. Smash TV plays great too, the only downside being that you can only play it single player. I can get around the shortage of arcade sticks by plugging in a 360 controller for a second player, but that is really missing the point of having a stand up arcade machine in your home.

We'll say, for now, everything works great, and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.
