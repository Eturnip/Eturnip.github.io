Last year I took part in a sort of challenge. Every weekend for five weekends write one story under 750 words. By the end of the challenge you end up with five stories (or six if you take part in the warmup round).

Even though I haven’t sold, or even finished rewrites and edits on any of the stories from last year, I’m trying it again this year (though 2 of them are very close).

I did find that 750 words is not really enough for me. I had a tendency to come up with two or four thousand word stories and I would try to cram them down into 750. As you can guess, this didn’t always work.

I think I will start being concise by ending this post here. After all, I already wrote a ~500 word story this weekend for the warmup round.
